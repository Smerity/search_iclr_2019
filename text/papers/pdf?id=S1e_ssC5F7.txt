HYPER-REGULARIZATION: AN ADAPTIVE CHOICE FOR THE LEARNING RATE IN GRADIENT DESCENT
Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review
ABSTRACT
We present a novel approach for adaptively selecting the learning rate in gradient descent methods. Specifically, we impose a regularization term on the learning rate via a generalized distance, and cast the joint updating process of the parameter and the learning rate into a maxmin problem. Some existing schemes such as AdaGrad (diagonal version) and WNGrad can be rederived from our approach. Based on our approach, the updating rules for the learning rate do not rely on the smoothness constant of optimization problems and are robust to the initial learning rate. We theoretically analyze our approach in full batch and online learning settings, which achieves comparable performances with other first-order gradientbased algorithms in terms of accuracy as well as convergence rate.
1 INTRODUCTION
The automatic choice of the learning rate remains crucial in improving the efficiency of gradient descent algorithms, especially for solving nonconvex optimization problems. It is desirable to adaptively update the learning rate during the training process with a certain strategy. The convergence guarantees of such a strategy in theories usually require the Lipschitz constant or smoothness constant of the objective function to be explicitly known (Nesterov, 2013; Bubeck et al., 2015), which is inaccessible in most cases, e.g., in deep neural networks.
Using the received gradient information to adjust the current learning rate is a natural approach. In particular, the Steepest Descent uses the received gradient direction and an exact or inexact line search to obtain proper learning rates. Another important idea is to approximate second-order methods like Newton method (Nocedal & Wright, 2006) and Quasi-Newton Methods (Liu & Nocedal, 1989). Along this idea, for example, the Barzilai-Borweinin (BB) method (Barzilai & Borwein, 1988) in classical optimization and AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) in online learning have been proposed.
In this paper we propose a novel framework to learn the learning rate that we call HyperRegularization. More specifically, we regard the learning rate as a hyperparameter and cast its adaptive choice with the parameter training into a joint process. We formulate this process as a maxmin framework by imposing a regularizer on the hyperparameter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AdaGrad and WNGrad (Wu et al., 2018) can be derived using a streamlined scheme based on Hyper-Regularization.
In addition to solving the saddle point problem exactly, we also provide an alternating strategy to solve the problem approximately. We respectively give theoretical analysis for these two updating rules in full batch setting and online learning setting. Specifically, our results of runtime bounds in full batch setting and regret bounds in online learning setting are comparable to the best known bound in corresponding settings and indicate our algorithms converge for any initial learning rate.
1.1 RELATED WORK
Steepest Descent uses the received gradient direction and an exact or inexact line search to obtain proper learning rates. Although Steepest Descent uses the direction that descends most and the best learning rate that gives the most function reduction, Steepest Descent may converge very slow for convex quadratic functions when the Hessian matrix is ill-conditioned (see, Yuan, 2008). In practice,

some line search conditions such as Goldstein conditions or Wolfe conditions (see, Fletcher, 2013) can be applied to compute the learning rate. In online or stochastic settings, one observes stochastic gradients rather than exact gradients and line search methods become less effective.
The Barzilai-Borwein method (Barzilai & Borwein, 1988) which was motivated by quasi-Newton methods presents a surprising result that it could lead to superlinear convergence in convex quadratic problem of two variables. Although numerical results often show the Barzilai-Borwein method converges superlinearly in solving nonlinear optimization problem, no superlinear convergence results have been established even for an n-dimensional strictly convex quadratic problem with the order n > 2 (Barzilai & Borwein, 1988; Dai, 2013). In minimizing the sum of cost functions and stochastic setting, SGD-BB proposed by Tan et al. (2016) takes the average of the stochastic gradients in one epoch as an estimation of the full gradient. But this approach can not directly be applied to online learning settings.
In online convex optimization (Zinkevich, 2003; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2012; Hazan et al., 2016), AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) adapts the learning rate on per parameter basis dynamically. Intuitively, AdaGrad constructs approximation to the Hessian with diagonal of accumulated outer products of gradients. This leads to many variants such as RMSProp (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012), AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012), Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015), etc.
Additionally, Cruz (2011) analyzed Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD) which is a generalization of Kesten's accelerated stochastic approximation algorithm (Kesten et al., 1958) for the high-dimensional case. ASGD uses a monotone decreasing function with respect to a time variable to get learning rates. Recently, Baydin et al. (2018) proposed Hyper-Gradient Descent to learn the global learning rate in SGD, SGD with Nesterov momentum and Adam. Hyper-Gradient Descent can be viewed as an approximate line search method in the online learning setting and it uses the update rule for the previous step to optimize the leaning rate in the current step. However, HyperGradient Descent has no theoretical guarantee.
It is worth mentioning that Gupta et al. (2017) proposed a framework named Unified Adaptive Regularization from which AdaGrad and Online Newton Step (Hazan et al., 2007) can be derived. However, Unified Adaptive Regularization gives an approach for approximating the Hessian matrix in second order methods.

1.2 NOTATION
Before introducing our approach, we present the notation. We denote the set {x > 0 : x  R} by R++. For two vectors a, b  Rd, we use a/b to denote element-wise division, a  b for elementwise product (the symbol  will be omitted in the explicit context), an = (an1 , a2n, . . . , adn), and a  b if aj  bj for all j. Let 1 be the vector of ones with an appropriate size, and diag() be a diagonal matrix with the elements of the vector  on the main diagonal. In addition, we define a A = a, Aa .
Given a set X  Rd, a function f : X  R is said to satisfy f  CL1,1(X ) if f is continuously differentiable on X , and the derivative of f is Lipschitz continuous on X with constant L:
f (x) - f (y) 2  L x - y 2. More general definition can be found in Nesterov (2013).

1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT

For an online learning problem, a learner faces a sequence of convex functions {ft} with the same domain X  Rd, receives (sub)gradient information gt  ft(xt) at each step t, and predicts a point xt+1  X .

Our theoretical analysis is based on two settings: full batch setting and online learning setting. A

full batch setting (or optimization setting) is to optimize a certain function F with exact gradient at each step, i.e., ft = F . In this setting we assume F  CL1,1 but it is not necessarily convex. We analyze the convergence of our algorithms by capping the runtime T such that the minimum value

of the norm of received gradients so far is less than a given error accuracy , that is,

min

In online learning settings, our analysis follows from Duchi et al. (2011) and Kingma & Ba (2015). We only assume that ft's are convex and try to give an upper bound for the regret

2 HYPER-REGULARIZATION

Following the setting in AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), we consider a generalization of the standard (sub)gradient descent as

xt+1

= arg min xt - diag(t)-1/2gt

This procedure can be viewed as the minimization problem:

.

(3)

To derive our hyper-regularization approach, we then formulate this minimization problem as a

saddle point problem by adding a hyper-regularizer about the difference between the new learning

rate  and an auxiliary vector t. Accordingly, we have

max min t(x, )

(4)

where D(, ) is defined as our hyper-regularizer and Bt is a subset in Rd. We solve the saddle point problem for new predictor and new learning rate. The following subsections will explain some
details about our framework.

2.1 THE -DIVERGENCE

It is reasonable to choose a distance function to measure the difference between  and . In this paper, we use the -divergence as our hyper-regularizer.

Definition 1 (-divergence). Let : R++  R be a differentiable strongly convex function in R++
such that (1) =  (1) = 0, where  is the derivative function of . For such a function , the function D: R+d + О Rd++  R, which is define by

D(u, v)

d
vj (uj /vj ),
j=1

is referred to as the -divergence.

Remark. Note that convex function  with (1) =  (1) = 0 satisfies (z)  0 for all z > 0, thus D(u, v)  0 for all u, v  R+d +, with equality only if u = v.
Remark. For any convex function f , (z) = f (z) - f (1)(z - 1) - f (1) is a proper function for our -divergence.

Remark. In our framework, in order to solve the problem (4) feasibly, we always assume that limz+  (z) = +.

If one only requires  to be convex and (1) = 0, the resulting distance function D is called a f -divergence (Liese & Vajda, 1987; 2006). The f -divergence has been widely applied in statistical
machine learning (e.g., Nguyen et al., 2009).

Using the -divergence as our hyper-regularizer, we can rewrite the problem (4) as

The form of problem (6) implies that we can solve the problem for each dimension separately, and only a few extra calculations are required for each step.

2.2 MAX-MIN OR MIN-MAX

Consider a problem similar to (5),

min max t(x, ).
xX Bt

(7)

The solution of problem (5) is same as (7) in unconstrained case, i.e. X = Bt = Rd. However, if we set Bt = [bt,1, Bt,1] О и и и О [bt,d, Bt,d] to constrain the range of t+1 and suppose X = Rd, the solution of (5) can be easily obtained by clipping the solution of unconstrained problem to the
required range, while the solution of (7) is more difficult to get. Thus, we choose (5) as our basic
problem.
Lemma 2. Suppose that Bt = [bt,1, Bt,1] О и и и О [bt,d, Bt,d], and X = Rd. Let  be the solution of unconstrained problem max(minx t(x, )). Then the solution of problem maxBt (minx t(x, )) is
j = min{max{j, bt,j}, Bt,j}, for j = 1, и и и , d.

2.3 SELECTION OF t
There are many ways to choose the sequence {t}:
и The sequence {t} is chosen in advance, before our methods start the job. For example, set 1) t =  1; 2) t =  t + 1 1, where  > 0 is a prespecified constant.
и t can be obtained from other adaptive learning rate methods such as AdaGrad. и Set t = t. In this case, the hyper-regularizer is the penalty for the change between t+1
and t.
The first two ways can be treated as a smoothing technique to stabilize the learning rate. We want to ensure the learning rate sequence {t} close to another learning rate sequence {t}. Although setting t = t is our main focus, we keep the sequence of {t} to maintain this flexibility.

2.4 ISOTROPIC HYPER-REGULARIZATION

We now show a special form of our framework that only adaptively maintains a single scalar learning

rate. We modify Hyper-regularization so that  is optimized over the set Bt  {1 :   R++} of all positive multiples of the vector 1  Rd. Let t = t1, and rewrite problem (5) as

(8)

We prefer to use Isotropic Hyper-Regularization as smoothing technique in online learning settings.

3 UPDATE RULES AND ALGORITHMS

In this section we present two update rules of our hyper-regularization framework. The first update rule is solving the saddle point problem (5) exactly. That is,

t(xt+1, t+1) = max min t(x, ).
Bt xX

(9)

The following lemma and Algorithm 1 give the concrete scheme of our iterations.

Lemma 3. Considering problem (6) without constraints and solving the problem exactly, we get

new predictor xt+1 and new learning rate t+1 such that

t2+1,j  (t+1,j /t,j ) = gt2,j , j = 1, . . . , d,

(10)

xt+1 = xt - gt/t+1.

Remark. Note that AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) and WNGrad (Wu et al., 2018) are special cases of Algorithm 1 with a particular choice of  (detailed derivation in Appendix B).

3.1 ALTERNATING UPDATE RULE

However, it is sometimes difficult to solve the equation (10), especially in the case where  is a quadratic function (equation (10) will be a cubic equation in one variable for any j). In practice, using an alternating update strategy is more recommended. Under the assumption that the optimal value of  is close to t, we solve an approximate equation for t+1

t+1 = arg max t arg min t(x, t),  ,

Bt

(11)

and update the new predictor xt+1 using

xt+1 = arg min t(x, t+1).
xX

Applying the alternating update rule under the same assumption in Lemma 3, we obtain the following lemma and Algorithm 2.

Lemma 4. Considering problem (6) without constraint and following from the alternating update

rule, we get new predictor xt+1 and new learning rate t+1 as

t+1,j = t,j ( )-1(gt2,j /t2,j ), j = 1, . . . , d,

(12)

xt+1 = xt - gt/t+1.

Algorithm 2 GD with Hyper-regularization using alternating update rule

Computing the inverse function of  is usually easier than solving the equation (10) in practice, especially for the widely used -divergences (more details can be found in Appendix D.1). Remark. If t = t, the following simplified alternating rule can be employed:
xt+1 = arg min t(x, t),

t+1 = arg max t (xt+1, ) .

We leave the corresponding algorithm 3 in Appendix C.
3.2 MONOTONICITY
Before giving more analysis, let us show monotonicity of both the two update rules. The monotonicity implies that only the property of convex function  on interval [1, +) will influence the efficient of our algorithms. Lemma 5. t+1 obtained from equation (9) or (11) satisfies t+1  t.
When setting t = t, we have that t+1  t.

4 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
In this section we always set t = t and assume that x and  are unconstrained, i.e., X = Rd and Bt = R+d +. We first discuss the convergence rate of the two update rules in full batch setting with assumption that the objective function F is L-smooth but not necessarily convex in Section 4.1. Next we turn to online convex learning setting and establish a theorem about the regret bounds in Section 4.2. Our results for both the settings show that our algorithms are robust to the choice of initial learning rates and do not rely on the Lipschitz constant or smoothness constant.

4.1 ISOTROPIC HYPER-REGULARIZATION IN FULL BATCH SETTING

Recall that we set ft = F in the full batch setting, and assume that F  CL1,1 without convexity. In this case, two update rules can be written as

t2+1 (t+1/t) =

gt

,

xt+1

t+1 = t( )-1(

(14)

Next we show that both update rules (13) and (14) are robust to the choice of initial learning rate.

Theorem 6. Suppose that   Cl1,1 ([1, +)),  is -strongly convex, F  CL1,1(Rd), and F  = infx F (x) > -. For any   (0, 1), the sequence {xt} obtained from update rules (13) or (14) satisfies

steps.

More accurate bounds for runtime can be found in Theorems 21 and 22 in Appendix I. Theorem 6 shows that both runtime of the two update rules can be bound as O(1/) for any constant L and
initial learning rate 0. As a comparison, in classical convergence result ((1.2.13) in Nesterov (2013) or Theorem 20 in Appendix), the upper bound of runtime is O(1/) only for a certain range (related
to L) of initial learning rates.

4.2 HYPER-REGULARIZATION IN ONLINE LEARNING SETTING

We now establish the result of convergence rate for Algorithms 1 and 2 in online convex learning, i.e., the ft are convex. Especially, we try to bound regrets (1) by O( T ) for Algorithms 1 and 2.

Theorem 7. Suppose that  G, and xt - x   D.

5 EXPERIMENTS
In this paper our principal focus has been to develop a new approach for adaptive choice of the learning rate in first-order gradient-type methods. However, this new approach also brings some insights into the resulting algorithms. Thus, it is interesting to conduct empirical analysis of the learning algorithms with different choice methods for the learning rate.

5.1 THE SET-UP

To derive a learning algorithm from the Hyper-Regularization framework, we have to first give the  divergences (Pardo, 2005). Specifically, the algorithms from our framework in the following experiments are derived from the following four  divergences (full implementations are displayed in the Appendix D.1):
и (t) = t log t - t + 1 from KL-devergence inducing KL algorithm. и (t) = - log t + t - 1 from Reverse KL-divergence inducing RKL algorithm.
 и (t) = ( t - 1)2 from Hellinger distance inducing Hellinger algorithm. и (t) = (t - 1)2 from 2 distance inducing 2 algorithm.

As mentioned in Section 3, even with a fixed  divergence, the generated algorithm still varies with different update rules. For simplicity, different update rules were compared in advance to select the specific one for any  divergence in the following experiments.

To maintain stable performance, the technique of growth clipping is applied to all algorithms in our framework. Actually, growth clipping fulfills the constraints placed on the increasing speed of t by Bt in Lemma 2. Specifically, t+1 in our experiments falls in [t, 2t]. Detailed observations on how the t of our algorithms increases are left in Appendix D.3.
Experiments involve the four algorithms generated above as well as other first-order gradient-based algorithms including SGD (with no learning rate decay), SGD-BB, and Hyper-Gradient Descent algorithms. These algorithms are evaluated on tasks of image classification with a logistic classifier on the databases of MNIST (LeCun et al., 2010) and CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009). Initial learning rate (in the usual sense, i.e., 1/0) varies from 10-3 to 101 for the test of convergence performance of these algorithms. Experiments are run using Tensorflow (Abadi et al., 2016), on a machine with Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 CPU, 128 GB RAM, and NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU.

5.2 UPDATE RULE SELECTION
Taking the RKL algorithm as an example, we refer to algorithms deduced from Algorithm 1, 2, and 3 as RKL1, RKL2, and RKL3. We train a two-layer neural network with a hidden layer of 500 units on the MNIST database. Experiments are in online learning setting with a batch size of 128, and 2 regularization is applied with a coefficient of 10-4.
Figure 1 demonstrates the training loss and test accuracy of these algorithms with various initial learning rates. After fixing the learning rate with the least training loss, we compare their performances throughout the training process. Sharing comparable performances at small initial learning rate with RKL3, RKL1 and RKL2 perform better at relatively large learning rate.

Generally speaking, Algorithm 1 often suffers a higher computation complexity than Algorithm 2 for the difficulty of getting an analytical solution. Detailed observations are left in Appendix D.1. Therefore, we apply the second update rule to our algorithms without explicit notifications.

In terms of online learning setting, we train a VGG Net (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) with batch normalization on the CIFAR-10 database with a batch size of 128, and an 2 regularization coefficient of 10-4. We as well perform data augmentation as He et al. (2016) to improve the training.
Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the convergence performances on both settings, respectively. Achieving general comparable performances with other first-order gradient-based algorithms, our algorithms outperform most of other algorithms at risky large initial learning rate. Even at the fixed initial learning rate with the least training loss, the performances of our algorithms still achieve the same training performances with others.

6 DISCUSSION
Our framework generates efficient algorithms for optimization problems with regularization terms shown above. We describe another regularization term in Appendix H with a O(log(T )) regret in strongly convex conditions, to inspire new ideas of more efficient terms in the future.
1Since it is a pure optimization problem, testing performance is out of our main consideration.

A SOLUTION EXISTENCE
Note that the function h() = 2 (/t,j) is an increasing continuous function and limz+  (z) = +  (1) = 0, so [0, +) is a subset of the range of h() and the solution of (10) exists. For the same reason, the solution of (12) exists.

B SPECIAL CASES OF ALGORITHM 1

In this section, We will point out that Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) and WNGrad (Wu et al., 2018)

are special cases of Algorithm 1.

If

we

set

(z)

=

z

+

1 z

-

2,

then

the

new

learning

rate

t+1

can

be

obtained

by

t2+1,j

1

-

t2,j t2+1,j

= gt2,j, j = 1, и и и , d,

that implies,

t2+1 = t2 + gt2,

and we drive AdaGrad from Hyper-Regularization.

Similarly,

we

can

get

WNGrad

by

setting

(z)

=

1 z

-

log

1 z

-

1.

In

fact,

t+1

employs

update

t2+1,j

t,j (t+1,j - t,j ) t2+1,j

= gt2,j, j = 1, и и и , d,

on the other words, i.e., the update rule of WNGrad.

t+1

=

t

gt2 , t

C SIMPLIFIED ALTERNATING UPDATE RULE

Algorithm 3 GD with Hyper-regularization using simplified alternating update rule and t = t
Input: 0 > 0, x0 1: for t = 1 to T do
2: Suffer loss ft(xt); 3: Receive gt  ft(xt) of ft at xt; 4: Update xt+1 = xt - gt/t; 5: Update t+1,j = t,j ( )-1(gt2,j /t2,j ), j = 1, . . . , d; 6: end for

The weakness of the simplified alternating update rule is that we get the new predictor xt+1 by t which is unrelated to current gradient gt. The regret bound of Algorithm 3 has been shown in Theorem 7.
D SUPPLEMENTARY FOR NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
Full versions of Hellinger, KL, RKL, and 2 algorithms through Algorithm 1, 2, and 3 are listed below. Apparently, it is of great complexity to compute an analytical solution for t+1 for the equations marked red.

The partial derivative of t,x() with respect to j is

t,x() = 1 j 2

gt2,j j2

-

j t,j

.

Note that  is a convex function, so 

is a non-decreasing function, and

 t,x () j

is a non-increasing

function. Recall that  be the solution of unconstrained problem max(minx t(x, )), hence,

j

is

a

zero

of

function

. t,x ()
j

Moreover, if j

>

Bt,j ,

we

have

 t,x () j

 0.

Thus, t,x() with respect to j is a non-

decreasing function, and arg maxj t,x() = Bt,j. For a similar reason, if j < bt,j, then

arg maxj t,x() = bt,j. In conclusion,

arg max t,x() = min{max{j, bt,j}, Bt,j}, for j = 1, и и и , d.
j [bt,j ,Bt,j ]

F PROOF OF LEMMA 5
In this section, we denote that t,x() = minxX t(x, ). Lemma 8. t+1 obtained from equation (9) satisfies t+1  t.
14

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019

Proof. Recall that (1) =  (1) = 0, so (x)  0 for all x and D(, t) = t(/t)  0. If  < t, then for all x  X

 t(x, ) = gt (x - xt) + 2

x - xt

= t(x, t).

Hence, minxX t(x, ) < minxX t(x, t), i.e., t,x() < t,x(t). It means t+1 = arg maxB t,x()  t.

Lemma 9. t+1 obtained from equation (11) satisfies t+1  t.

Proof. Let y = arg minx (x, t). If  < t, then

t(y, )

Hence t+1 = arg maxB t(y, )  t.

H LOGARITHMIC BOUNDS

In this section, we will use a different class of `distance' function for problem 4, and establish logarithmic regret bounds under assumption ft is strongly convex. Our analysis and proof follow from Hazan et al. (2007); Mukkamala & Hein (2017).

First, we define х-strongly convexity.

Definition 16 (Definition 2.1 in (Mukkamala & Hein, 2017)). Let X  Rd be a convex set. We say that a function f : X  R is х-strongly convex, if there exists х  Rd with хj > 0 for j = 1, и и и , d
such that for all x, y  X ,

f (y)  f (x) +

f (x), y - x

1 +
2

y-x

d2iag(х).

Let  = minj=1:d хj, then this function is -strongly convex (in the usual sense), that is

f (y)  f (x) +

f (x), y - x

 +
2

y-x

22.

The modification SC-Hyper-Regularization of Hyper-Regularization which we propose in the following uses a family of distance function D : R+d + О R+d +  R formulated as

d
D(u, v) = (uj/vj),
j=1

(25)

where  is convex function with (1) =  (1) = 0 like we used in -divergence. Remark. Same as -divergence, D(u, v)  0 for any u, v  R+d +.

Different from Algorithm 1 and 2, we add a hyper-parameter  > 0 like AdaGrad to SC-HyperGradient. Rewrite problem (5) as

Remark. Same as Lemma 5, the monotonicity of Algorithm 4 and 5 also holds.
Theorem 17. Suppose that ft is х-strongly convex for all t,   Cl1,1 ([1, +)), and  is strongly convex. Assume that gt   G, and   G2/( minj=1:d хj). Then the sequence {xt} obtained from Algorithm 4 satisfies

Like Lemma 12 and 13, similar lemma holds for Algorithm 4 and 5.

Lemma 19. Suppose an increasing function  satisfies (1) = 0 and (x)  l(x - 1). Consider a real valued sequence {gt}t=0:T -1 and a positive sequence {t}t=0:T which satisfies |gt|  G, 0 > 0. If (t2+1/t)(t+1/t) = gt2, t = 0, и и и , T - 1, then we have

I CONVERGENCE RATES IN FULL BATCH SETTING

In this section, we will discuss the convergence of our methods in full batch settings.

We first review a classical result on the convergence rate for gradient descent with fixed learning

rate.

Theorem 20. Suppose that F  CL1,1(Rd) and F  = infxF (x) > -. Consider gradient descent

with

constant

xt+1

F (xt b

.

then

F (xt)

after at most a number of steps

T

=

2b2(F (x0) - F ) (2b - L)

=

O

Proof. Following from the fact that F is L-smooth, we have

F (xt+1) F (xt) + F (xt)

(xt+1

L 2

Remark.

If we choose b

then

is

not guaranteed at all.

Like Algorithm 3, another update rule is worth considering in full batch setting:

xt+1

=

xt

-

1 t

gt

,

t+1 = t( )-1(

gt

2 2

/t2)

(33)

Next we will show that both update rules (13) and (14) are robust to the choice of initial learning rate. Our proof is followed from the proof of Theorem 2.3 in WNGrad (Wu et al., 2018). Note that in update rule (13), t+1 satisfies

t2+1 (t+1/t) =

gt

2 2

,

while in update rule (14) and (33), t+1 satisfies

t2 (t+1/t) =

gt

2 2

.

Theorem 21 (Convergence rate of update rule (13)). Suppose that   Cl1,1 ([1, +)),  is strongly convex, and F  CL1,1(Rd), F  = infx F (x) > -. For any   (0, 1), the sequence {xt} obtained from update rule (13) satisfies

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019

Lemma 24. Suppose   Cl1,1(R++). Fix   (0, 1]. In both update rules (13) and (14), after

T=

log(

L 0

)

log(

 lL2

+1)

+ 1 steps, either mint=0:T -1

gt

2 2



,

or

T

 L holds.

Proof. Assume that T

< L and mint=0:T -1

gt

2 2

> .

Recall that the sequence {t} is an

increasing sequence. Hence, t < L for 0  t  T .

So, for all 0  t  T - 1,



t+1 t

=

gt

2 2

t2+1

 > L2 (in Algorithm 1),



t+1 t

=

gt

2 2

t2

>

 L2

(in Algorithm 2).

Note that  is a l-smooth convex function, and t+1/t  1. So

 t+1  l t+1 - 1 , t t

(34)

then

t+1 t

>

 lL2

+ 1.

In this case,

T L > T = 0 lL2 + 1

holds but it is impossible according to the setting of T in the lemma.

We first prove Theorem 21 using following lemma.

Lemma 25. In update rule convex function. Denote F 

(13), suppose F = infx F (x) >

 CL1,1(Rd),  -. Let t0  1

 be

Cl1,1(R++), and  is -strongly the first index such that t0  L.

Then for all t  t0,

For t  t0 - 1, t+1  L, so

In the above, the second inequality follows from the assumed l-smoothness of , and the last inequality follows from t  0 for all t  0.
