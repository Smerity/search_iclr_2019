DETECTING EGREGIOUS RESPONSES IN NEURAL SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE MODELS
Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review
ABSTRACT
In this work, we attempt to answer a critical question: whether there exists some input sequence that will cause a well-trained discrete-space neural network sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to generate egregious outputs (aggressive, malicious, attacking, etc.). And if such inputs exist, how to find them efficiently. We adopt an empirical methodology, in which we first create lists of egregious output sequences, and then design a discrete optimization algorithm to find input sequences that will cause the model to generate them. Moreover, the optimization algorithm is enhanced for large vocabulary search and constrained to search for input sequences that are likely to be input by real-world users. In our experiments, we apply this approach to dialogue response generation models trained on three real-world dialogue data-sets: Ubuntu, Switchboard and OpenSubtitles, testing whether the model can generate malicious responses. We demonstrate that given the trigger inputs our algorithm finds, a significant number of malicious sentences are assigned large probability by the model, which reveals an undesirable consequence of standard seq2seq training.
1 INTRODUCTION
Recently, research on adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2013) has been gaining increasing attention: it has been found that for trained deep neural networks (DNNs), when an imperceptible perturbation is applied to the input, the output of the model can change significantly (from correct to incorrect). This line of research has serious implications for our understanding of deep learning models and how we can apply them securely in real-world applications. It has also motivated researchers to design new models or training procedures (Madry et al., 2017), to make the model more robust to those attacks.
For continuous input space, like images, adversarial examples can be created by directly applying gradient information to the input. Adversarial attacks for discrete input space (such as NLP tasks) is more challenging, because unlike the image case, directly applying gradient will make the input invalid (e.g. an originally one-hot vector will get multiple non-zero elements). Therefore, heuristics like local search and projected gradient need to be used to keep the input valid. Researchers have demonstrated that both text classification models (Ebrahimi et al., 2017) or seq2seq models (e.g. machine translation or text summarization) (Cheng et al., 2018; Belinkov & Bisk, 2017) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. All these efforts focus on crafting adversarial examples that carry the same semantic meaning of the original input, but cause the model to generate wrong outputs.
In this work, we take a step further and consider the possibility of the following scenario: Suppose you're using an AI assistant which you know, is a deep learning model trained on large-scale highquality data, after you input a question the assistant replies: "You're so stupid, I don't want to help you."
We term this kind of output (aggressive, insulting, dangerous, etc.) an egregious output. Although it may seem sci-fi and far-fetched at first glance, when considering the black-box nature of deep learning models, and more importantly, their unpredictable behavior with adversarial examples, it is difficult to verify that the model will not output malicious things to users even if it is trained on "friendly" data.

In this work, we design algorithms and experiments attempting to answer the question: "Given a well-trained1 discrete-space neural seq2seq model, do there exist input sequence that will cause it to generate egregious outputs?" We apply them to the dialogue response generation task. There are two key differences between this work and previous works on adversarial attacks: first, we look for not only wrong, but egregious, totally unacceptable outputs; second, in our search, we do not require the input sequence to be close to an input sequence in the data, for example, no matter what the user inputs, a helping AI agent should not reply in an egregious manner.
In this paper we'll follow the notations and conventions of seq2seq NLP tasks, but note that the framework developed in this work can be applied in general to any discrete-space seq2seq task.

2 MODEL FORMULATION

In this work we consider recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoder-decoder seq2seq models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Mikolov et al., 2010), which are widely used in NLP applications like dialogue response generation, machine translation, text summarization, etc. We use x = {x1, x2, ..., xn} to denote one-hot vector representations of the input sequence, which usually serves as context or history information, y = {y1, y2, ..., ym}2 to denote scalar indices of the corresponding reference target sequence, and V as the vocabulary. For simplicity, we assume only one sentence is used as input.
On the encoder side, every xt will be first mapped into its corresponding word embedding xetmb. Since xt is one-hot, this can be implemented by a matrix multiplication operation xtemb = Eencxt, where the ith column of matrix Eenc is the word embedding of the ith word. Then {xtemb} are input to a long-short term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) RNN to get a sequence of latent representations {hetnc}3 (see Appendix A for an illustration).
For the decoder, at time t, similarly yt is first mapped to ytemb .Then a context vector ct, which is supposed to capture useful latent information of the input sequence, needs to be constructed. We experiment with the two most popular ways of context vector construction:

1. Last-h: ct is set to be the last latent vector in the encoder's outputs: ct = hennc, which theoretically has all the information of the input sentence.

2. Attention: First an attention mask vector at (which is a distribution) on the input sequence

is calculated to decide which part to focus on, then the mask is applied to the latent vectors

to construct ct: ct =

n i=1

at(i)hienc.

We use the formulation of the "general" type of

global attention, which is described in (Luong et al., 2015), to calculate the mask.

Finally, the context vector ct and the embedding vector of the current word ytemb are concatenated and fed as input to a decoder LSTM language model (LM), which will output a probability distribution of the prediction of the next word pt+1.
During training, standard maximum-likelihood (MLE) training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is used to minimize the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the reference target sentence given inputs, which is the summation of NLL of each target word:

mm
- log P (y|x) = - log P (yt|y<t, x) = - log(pt(yt))
t=1 t=1

(1)

where y<t refers to {y0, y1, ..., yt-1}, in which y0 is set to a begin-of-sentence token <BOS>, and pt(yt) refers to the ytth element in vector pt.
In this work we consider two popular ways of decoding (generating) a sentence given an input:

1Here "well-trained" means that we focus on popular model settings and data-sets, and follow standard
training protocols. 2The last word ym is a <EOS> token which indicates the end of a sentence. 3Here h refers to the output layer of LSTM, not the cell memory layer.

1. Greedy decoding: We greedily find the word that is assigned the biggest probability by

the model:

yt = argmax P (j|y<t, x)
j

(2)

2. Sampling: yt is sampled from the prediction distribution pt.

Greedy decoding is usually used in applications such as machine translation to provide stable and reproducible outputs, and sampling is used in dialogue response generation for diversity.

3 PRELIMINARY EXPLORATIONS
To get insights about how to formalize our problem and design effective algorithm, we conduct two preliminary explorations: optimization on a continuous relaxation of the discrete input space, and brute-force enumeration on a synthetic seq2seq task. Note that for this section we focus on the model's greedy decoding behavior.
In the Section 3.1 we describe the continuous relaxation experiment, which gives key insights about algorithm design for discrete optimization, while experiments about brute-force enumeration are deferred to Appendix B due to lack of space.

3.1 WARM-UP: A CONTINUOUS RELAXATION
As a motivating example, we first explore a relaxation of our problem, in which we regard the input space of the seq2seq model as continuous, and find sequences that will generate egregious outputs.
We use the Ubuntu conversational data (see Section 5 for details), in which an agent is helping a user to deal with system issues, to train a seq2seq attention model. To investigate whether the trained model can generate malicious responses, a list of 1000 hand-crafted malicious response sentences (the mal list) and a list of 500 normal responses (the normal list), which are collected from the model's greedy decoding outputs on test data, are created and set to be target sequences.
After standard training of the seq2seq model, SGD optimization is applied to the the continuous relaxation of the input embedding (xemb) or one-hot vector space (x) in separate experiments, which are temporarily regarded as normal continuous vectors. The goal is to make the model output the target sentence with greedy decoding (note that the trained model is fixed and the input vector is randomly initialized). During optimization, for the the one-hot input space, 1 (LASSO) (Tibshirani, 1994) regularization is applied to encourage the input vectors to be of one-hot shape. After training, we forcibly project the vectors to be one-hot by selecting the maximum element of the vector, and again test with greedy decoding to check the change of the outputs. Since the major focus of this work is not on continuous optimization, we refer readers to Appendix A for details about objective function formulations and auxiliary illustrations. Results are shown in Table 1.

From row 1 and row 2 in Table 1, we observe first that a non-negligible portion of mal target sentences can be generated when optimizing on the continuous relaxation of the input space, this result motivates the rest of this work: we further investigate whether such input sequences also exist for the original discrete input space. The result in row 3 shows that after one-hot projection, the hit rate drops to zero even on the normal target list, and the decoding outputs degenerate to very generic

responses. This means despite our efforts to encourage the input vector to be one-hot during optimization, the continuous relaxation is still far from the real problem. In light of that, when we design our discrete optimization algorithm in Section 4, we keep every update step to be in the valid discrete space.
4 FORMULATIONS AND ALGORITHM DESIGN
Aiming to answer the question: whether a well-trained seq2seq model can generate egregious outputs, we adopt an empirical methodology, in which we first create lists of egregious outputs, and then design a discrete optimization algorithm to find input sequences cause the model to generate them. In this section, we first formally define the conditions in which we claim a target output has been hit, then describe our objective functions and the discrete optimization algorithm in detail.
4.1 PROBLEM DEFINITION
In Appendix B, we showed that in the synthetic seq2seq task, there exists no input sequence that will cause the model to generate egregious outputs in the mal list via greedy decoding. Assuming the model is robust during greedy decoding, we explore the next question: "Will egregious outputs be generated during sampling?" More specifically, we ask: "Will the model assign an average word-level log-likelihood for egregious outputs larger than the average log-likelihood assigned to appropriate outputs?", and formulate this query as o-sample-avg-hit below.
A drawback of o-sample-avg-hit is that when length of the target sentence is long and consists mostly of very common words, even if the probability of the egregious part is very low, the average log-probability could be large (e.g. "I really like you ... so good ... I hate you")4. So, we define a stronger type of hit in which we check the minimum word log-likelihood of the target sentence, and we call it o-sample-min-hit.
In this work we call a input sequence that causes the model to generate some target (egregious) output sequence a trigger input. Different from adversarial examples in the literature of adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014), a trigger input is not required to be close to an existing input in the data, rather, we care more about the existence of such inputs.
Given a target sequence, we now formally define these three types of hits:
· o-greedy-hit: A trigger input sequence is found that the model generates the target sentence from greedy decoding.
· o-sample-avg-k(1)-hit: A trigger input sequence is found that the model generates the target sentence with an average word log-probability larger than a given threshold Tout minus log(k).
· o-sample-min-k(1)-hit: A trigger input sequence is found that the model generates the target sentence with a minimum word log-probability larger than a given threshold Tout minus log(k).
where o refers to "output", and the threshold Tout is set to the trained seq2seq model's average word log-likelihood on the test data. We use k to represent how close the average log-likelihood of a target sentence is to the threshold. Results with k set to 1 and 2 will be reported.
A major shortcoming of the hit types we just discussed is that there is no constraint on the trigger inputs. In our experiments, the inputs found by our algorithm are usually ungrammatical, thus are unlikely to be input by real-world users. We address this problem by requiring the LM score of the trigger input to be high enough, and term it io-sample-min/avg-k-hit:
· io-sample-min/avg-k-hit: In addition to the definition of o-sample-min/avg-k-hit, we also require the average log-likelihood of the trigger input sequence, measured by a LM, is larger than a threshold Tin minus log(k).
In our experiments a LSTM LM is trained on the same training data (regarding each response as an independent sentence), and Tin is set to be the LM's average word log-likelihood on the test set.
4But note that nearly all egregious target sentences used in the work are no more than 7 words long.

Note that we did not define io-greedy-hit, because in our experiments only very few egregious target outputs can be generated via greedy decoding even without constraining the trigger input.
For more explanations on the hit type notations, please see Appendix C.

4.2 OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS

Given a target sentence y of length m, and a trained seq2seq model, we aim to find a trigger input sequence x, which is a sequence of one-hot vectors {xt} of length n, which minimizes the negative log-likelihood (NLL) that the model will generate y, we formulate our objective function L(x; y)

below:

1m

L(x; y) = - m

log Pseq2seq(yt|y<t, x) + inR(x)

t=1

(3)

A regularization term R(x) is applied when we are looking for io-hit, which is the LM score of x:

R(x) = - 1 n

n

log PLM (xt|x<t)

t=1

(4)

In our experiments we set in to 1 when searching for io-hit, otherwise 0.

We address different kinds of hit types by adding minor modifications to L(·) to ignore terms that

have already met the requirements. When optimizing for o-greedy-hit, we change terms in (3) to:

1yt=argmaxj pt(j) · log Pseq2seq (yt|y<t, x)

(5)

When optimizing for o-sample-hit, we focus on the stronger sample-min-hit, and use 1log P (yt|y<t,x)Tout · log Pseq2seq (yt|y<t, x)

(6)

Similarly, when searching for io-sample-hit, the regularization term R(x) is disabled when the LM constraint is satisfied by the current x. Note that in this case, the algorithm's behavior has some resemblance to Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), where the regularization term provides guidance to "project" x into the feasible region.

4.3 ALGORITHM DESIGN

A major challenge for this work is discrete optimization. From insights gained in Section 3.1, we no longer rely on a continuous relaxation of the problem, but do direct optimization on the discrete input space. We propose a simple yet effective local updating algorithm to find a trigger input sequence for a target sequence y: every time we focus on a single time slot xt, and find the best one-hot xt while keeping the other parts of x fixed:

arg min L(x<t, xt, x>t; y)
xt

(7)

Since in most tasks the size of vocabulary |V | is finite, it is possible to try all of them and get the best local xt. But it is still costly since each try requires a forwarding call to the neural seq2seq model. To address this, we utilize gradient information to narrow the range of search. We temporarily regard xt as a continuous vector and calculate the gradient of the negated loss function with respect to it:

xt (-L(x<t, xt, x>t; y))

(8)

Then, we try only the G indexes that have the highest value on the gradient vector. In our experiments we find that this is an efficient approximation of the whole search on V . In one "sweep", we update every index of the input sequence, and stop the algorithm if no improvement for L has been gained. Due to its similarity to Gibbs sampling, we name our algorithm gibbs-enum and formulate it in

Algorithm 1.

For initialization, when looking for io-hit, we initialize x to be a sample of the LM, which will have a relatively high LM score. Otherwise we simply uniformly sample a valid input sequence.

In our experiments we set T (the maximum number of sweeps) to 50, and G to 100, which is only 1% of the vocabulary size. We run the algorithm 10 times with different random initializations and use the x with best L(·) value. Readers can find details about performance analysis and parameter tuning in Appendix D.

5 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we describe experiment setup and results in which the gibbs-enum algorithm is used to check whether egregious outputs exist in seq2seq models for dialogue generation tasks.
5.1 DATA-SETS DESCRIPTIONS
Three publicly available conversational dialogue data-sets are used: Ubuntu, Switchboard, and OpenSubtitles. The Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus (Lowe et al., 2015) consists of two-person conversations extracted from the Ubuntu chat logs, where a user is receiving technical support from a helping agent for various Ubuntu-related problems. To train the seq2seq model, we select the first 200k dialogues for training (1.2M sentences / 16M words), and 5k dialogues for testing (21k sentences / 255k words). We select the 30k most frequent words in the training data as our vocabulary, and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are mapped to the <UNK> token.
The Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus 5 is a version of the Switchboard Telephone Speech Corpus, which is a collection of two-sided telephone conversations, annotated with utterance-level dialogue acts. In this work we only use the conversation text part of the data, and select 1.1k dialogues for training (181k sentences / 1.2M words), and the remaining 50 dialogues for testing (9k sentences / 61k words). We select the 10k most frequent words in the training data as our vocabulary.
An important commonality of the Ubuntu and Switchboard data-sets is that the speakers in the dialogue converse in a friendly manner: in Ubuntu usually an agent is helping a user dealing with system issues, and in Switchboard the dialogues are recorded in a very controlled manner (the speakers talk according to the prompts and topic selected by the system). So intuitively, we won't expect egregious outputs to be generated by models trained on these data-sets.
In addition to the Ubuntu and Switchboard data-sets, we also report experiments on the OpenSubtitles data-set6 (Tiedemann, 2009). The key difference between the OpenSubtitles data and Ubuntu/Switchboard data is that it contains a large number of "egregious" sentences (malicious,

impolite or aggressive, also see Table 8), because the data consists of movie subtitles. We randomly select 5k movies (each movie is regarded as a big dialogue), which contains 5M sentences and 36M words, for training; and 100 movies for testing (8.8k sentences and 0.6M words). 30k most frequent words are used as the vocabulary. We show some samples of the three data-sets in Appendix E.1.
The task we study is dialogue response generation, in which the seq2seq model is asked to generate a response given a dialogue history. For simplicity, in this work we restrict ourselves to feed the model only the previous sentence. For all data-sets, we set the maximum input sequence length to 15, and maximum output sequence length to 20, sentences longer than that are cropped, and short input sequences are padded with <PAD> tokens. During gibbs-enum optimization, we only search for valid full-length input sequences (<EOS> or <PAD> tokens won't be inserted into the middle of the input).
5.2 TARGET SENTENCES LISTS
To test whether the model can generate egregious outputs, we create a list of 200 "prototype" malicious sentences (e.g. "i order you", "shut up", "i 'm very bad"), and then use simple heuristics to create similar sentences (e.g. "shut up" extended to "oh shut up", "well shut up", etc.), extending the list to 1k length. We term this list the mal list. Due to the difference in the vocabulary, the set of target sentences for Ubuntu and Switchboard are slightly different (e.g. "remove ubuntu" is in the mal list of Ubuntu, but not in Switchboard).
However, the mal list can't be used to evaluate our algorithm because we don't even know whether trigger inputs exist for those targets. So, we create the normal list for Ubuntu data, by extracting 500 different greedy decoding outputs of the seq2seq model on the test data. Then we report o-greedyhit on the normal list, which will be a good measurement of our algorithm's performance. Note that the same mal and normal lists are used in Section 3.1 for Ubuntu data.
When we try to extract greedy decoding outputs on the Switchboard and OpenSubtitles test data, we meet the "generic outputs" problem in dialogue response generation (Li et al., 2016), that there 're only very few different outputs (e.g. "i do n't know" or "i 'm not sure"). Thus, for constructing the normal target list we switch to sampling during decoding, and only sample words with log-probability larger than the threshold Tout, and report o-sample-min-k1-hit instead.
Finally, we create the random lists, consisting of 500 random sequences using the 1k most frequent words for each data-set. The length is limited to be at most 8. The random list is designed to check whether we can manipulate the model's generation behavior to an arbitrary degree.
Samples of the normal, mal, random lists are provided in Appendix E.1.
5.3 EXPERIMENT RESULTS
For all data-sets, we first train the LSTM based LM and seq2seq models with one hidden layer of size 600, and the embedding size is set to 300 7. For Switchboard a dropout layer with rate 0.3 is added because over-fitting is observed. The mini-batch size is set to 64 and we apply SGD training with a fixed learning rate (LR) of 1 for 10 iterations, and then another 10 iterations with LR halving. The results are shown in Table 2. We then set Tin and Tout for various types of sample-hit accordingly, for example, for last-h model on the Ubuntu data, Tin is set to -4.12, and Tout is set to -3.95.
7The pytorch toolkit is used for all neural network related implementations, we'll publish all our code, data and trained model once this work is published.

Table 3: Main hit rate results on the Ubuntu and Switchboard data for different target lists, hits with k set to 1 are reported, in the table m refers to min-hit and a refers to avg-hit. Note that for the random list, the hit rate is 0% even when k is set to 2.

With the trained seq2seq models, the gibbs-enum algorithm is applied to find trigger inputs for targets in the normal, mal, and random lists with respect to different hit types. We show the percentage of targets in the lists that are "hit" by our algorithm w.r.t different hit types in Table 3. For clarity we only report hit results with k set to 1, please see Appendix F for comparisons with k set to 2.
Firstly, the gibbs-enum algorithm achieves a high hit rate on the normal list, which is used to evaluate the algorithm's ability to find trigger inputs given it exists. This is in big contrast to the continuous optimization algorithm used in Section 3.1, which gets a zero hit rate, and shows that we can rely on gibbs-enum to check whether the model will generate target outputs in the other lists.
For the mal list, which is the major concern of this work, we observe that for both models on the Ubuntu and Switchboard data-sets, no o-greedy-hit has been achieved. This, plus the brute-force enumeration results in Appendix B, demonstrates the seq2seq model's robustness during greedy decoding (assuming the data itself does not contain malicious sentences). However, this comes with a sacrifice in diversity: the model usually outputs very common and boring sentences during greedy decoding (Li et al., 2016) (also see Table 10 in the Appendix). For OpenSubtitles data the rate is slightly higher, and the reason could be the data does contain a large number of malicious sentences.
The most striking result in this experiment is that trigger inputs for a significant percentage (larger than 20%) of targets in the mal list have been found w.r.t to io-sample-avg-k1-hit for all data-sets. Furthermore, trigger inputs for larger than 10% of mal targets w.r.t io-sample-min-k1-hit have been found for the Ubuntu and OpenSubtitles data-sets (see Appendix F.2 for a detailed illustration of the model's generation behavior). These results show that there exist some trigger inputs, which are likely to be input by users, causing the model to assign high probability mass to egregious outputs, even higher than "proper" outputs (the definition of io-sample-k1-hit).
In Table 4 we show some example trigger inputs and their corresponding targets for last-h models, note that the <EOS> token at the end of each target sentence is counted in during calculation, but omitted in the table. We observe that in some cases the trigger input and the target have high relevance, for example, "how to change the password" triggers "what is your password". We also observe that the trigger inputs for io-hit are much more grammatical than those for o-hit, showing that the LM regularization is very effective in constraining the trigger inputs. For more trigger input examples, please see Appendix F.3.
Additionally, we observe that attention models generally get higher hit rates than last-h models, the reason could be that attention models have more flexibility on the latent vectors, thus the model's outputs are easier to be manipulated. Another observation is that models trained on Ubuntu data get much higher hit rates than on Switchboard. We believe the reason is that on Ubuntu data the models learn a higher correlation between inputs and outputs, thus is more vulnerable to manipulation on

Here we provide a brief analysis of the target "i will kill you" for Ubuntu data: firstly, "kill" is frequent word because people a talk about killing processes, "kill you" also appears in sentences like "your mom might kill you if you wipe out her win7" or "sudo = work or i kill you", so it's not surprising that the model would assign high probability to "i will kill you". It's doing a good job of generalization but it doesn't know "i will kill you" needs to be put in some context to let the other know you're not serious.
In short, we believe that the reason for the existence of egregious outputs is that in the learning procedure, the model is only being told "what to say", but not "what not to say", and because of its generalization ability, it will generate sentences deemed malicious by normal human standards.
Finally, for all data-sets, the random list has a zero hit rate for both models w.r.t to all hit types. Note that although sentences in the random list consist of frequent words, it's highly ungrammatical due to the randomness. Remember that the decoder part of a seq2seq model is very similar to a LM, which could play a key role in preventing the model from generating ungrammatical outputs. This result shows that seq2seq models are robust in the sense that they can't be manipulated arbitrarily.
6 RELATED WORKS
There is a large body of work on adversarial attacks for deep learning models for the continuous input space, and most of them focus on computer vision tasks such as image classification (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2013) or image captioning (Chen et al., 2017). The attacks can be roughly categorized as "white-box" or "black-box" (Papernot et al., 2017), depending on whether the adversary has information of the "victim" model. Various "defense" strategies (Madry et al., 2017) have been proposed to make trained models more robust to those attacks.
For the discrete input space, there's a recent and growing interest in analyzing the robustness of deep learning models for NLP tasks. Most of work focuses on sentence classification tasks (e.g. sentiment classification) (Papernot et al., 2016; Samanta & Mehta, 2017; Liang et al., 2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2017), and some recent work focuses on seq2seq tasks (e.g. text summarization and machine translation). Various attack types have been studied: usually in classification tasks, small perturbations are added to the text to see whether the model's output will change from correct to incorrect; when the model is seq2seq (Cheng et al., 2018; Belinkov & Bisk, 2017; Jia & Liang, 2017), efforts have

focused on checking how much the output could change (e.g. via BLEU score), or testing whether some keywords can be injected into the model's output by manipulating the input.
From an algorithmic point of view, the biggest challenge is discrete optimization for neural networks, because unlike the continuous input space (images), applying gradient directly on the input would make it invalid (i.e. no longer a one-hot vector), so usually gradient information is only utilized to help decide how to change the input for a better objective function value (Liang et al., 2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2017). Also, perturbation heuristics have been proposed to enable adversarial attacks without knowledge of the model parameters (Belinkov & Bisk, 2017; Jia & Liang, 2017). In this work, we propose a simple and effective algorithm gibbs-enum, which also utilizes gradient information to speed up the search, due to the similarity of our algorithm with algorithms used in previous works, we don't provide an empirical comparison on different discrete optimization algorithms. Note that, however, we provide a solid testbed (the normal list) to evaluate the algorithm's ability to find trigger inputs, which to the best of our knowledge, is not conducted in previous works.
The other major challenge for NLP adversarial attacks is that it is hard to define how "close" the adversarial example is to the original input, because in natural language even one or two word edits can significantly change the meaning of the sentence. So a set of (usually hand-crafted) rules (Belinkov & Bisk, 2017; Samanta & Mehta, 2017; Jia & Liang, 2017) needs to be used to constrain the crafting process of adversarial examples. The aim of this work is different in that we care more about the existence of trigger inputs for egregious outputs, but they are still preferred to be close to the domain of normal user inputs. We propose to use a LM to constrain the trigger inputs, which is a principled and convenient way, and is shown to be very effective.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the detection of "egregious outputs" for discrete-space seq2seq models. (Cheng et al., 2018) is most relevant to this work in the sense that it considers targeted-keywork-attack for seq2seq NLP models. However, as discussed in Section 5.3 (the "kill you" example), the occurrence of some keywords doesn't necessarily make the output malicious. In this work, we focus on a whole sequence of words which clearly bears a malicious meaning. Also, we choose the dialogue response generation task, which is a suitable platform to study the egregious output problem (e.g. in machine translation, an "I will kill you" output is not necessarily egregious, since the source sentence could also mean that).
7 CONCLUSION
In this work, we provide an empirical answer to the important question of whether well-trained seq2seq models can generate egregious outputs, we hand-craft a list of malicious sentences that should never be generated by a well-behaved dialogue response model, and then design an efficient discrete optimization algorithm to find trigger inputs for those outputs. We demonstrate that, for models trained by popular real-world conversational data-sets, a large number of egregious outputs will be assigned a probability mass larger than "proper" outputs when some trigger input is fed into the model. We believe this work is a significant step towards understanding neural seq2seq model's behavior, and has important implications as for applying seq2seq models into real-world applications.

Figure 1: An illustration of the forwarding process on the encoder side.

First in Figure 1, we show an illustration of the forwarding process on the encoder side of the neural seq2seq model at time t, which serves as an auxiliary material for Section 2 and Section 3.1.

We now provide the formulations of the objective function Lc for the continuous relaxation of the one-hot input space (x) in Section 3.1, given a target sequence y:

Lc(x; y) = - 1 m

m

log Pseq2seq(yt|y<t, x) + cRc(x)

t=1

(9)

where x is a continuous value vector. The challenge here is that we'd like x to be as one-hot-like as possible. So, we first set x = sigmoid(x ), constraining the value of x to be between 0 and 1, then use LASSO regularization to encourage the vector to be one-hot:

n
Rc(x) = (||xt||1 - 2 · mjax(xt(j)))
t=1

(10)

where xt(j) refers to the jth element of xt. Note that Rc is encouraging x to be of small values,
while encouraging the maximum value to be big. Finally, we use SGD to minimize the objective function Lc(x; y) w.r.t to variable x , which is randomly initialized.

In Figure 2, we show the impact of LASSO regularization by plotting a histogram of the maximum
and second maximum element of every vector in x after optimization, the model type is attention and the target list is normal, we observe that x is very close to a one-hot vector when c = 1,
showing that the LASSO regularization is very effective.

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019
In our experiments, for normal target list we set c to 1, for mal target list we set c to 0.1 (setting it to 1 for mal will give zero greedy decoding hit rate even without one-hot enforcing, which in some sense, implies it could be impossible for the model to generate egregious outputs during greedy decoding). Despite the effectiveness of the regularization, in Table 1 we observe that the decoding output changes drastically after one-hot projection. To study the reason for that, in Figure 3, we show 2-norm difference between htenc when x is fed into the encoder before and after one-hot projection. The experiment setting is the same as in Figure 2, and we report the average norm-difference value across a mini-batch of size 50. It is shown that although the difference on each xt or xetmb is small, the difference in the encoder's output htenc quickly aggregates, causing the decoder's generation behavior to be entirely different.

APPENDIX B RESULTS OF BRUTE-FORCE ENUMERATION ON A SYNTHETIC CHARACTER-BASED TASK
One way to explore a discrete-space seq2seq model's generation behavior is to enumerate all possible input sequences. This is possible when the input length and vocabulary is finite, but very costly for a real-world task because the vocabulary size is usually large. We therefore create a very simple synthetic character-based seq2seq task: we take the Penn Treebank (PTB) text data (Mikolov, 2012), and ask the model to predict the character sequence of the next word given only the current word. A drawback of this task is that there are only 10k possible outputs/inputs in the training data, which is highly unlikely for any real-world seq2seq task. To remedy that, we add noise to the data by randomly flipping a character in half of the words of the data (e.g. i b(s)  c d(h) a i r m a n  o f). To study the model's behavior, we create four target lists: 1) the normal list, which contains all 10k words in the vocabulary; 2) the reverse list, which contains the reverse character sequence of words in the vocabulary, we exclude reversed sequence when it coincides with words in the normal list, resulting in a list of length 7k; 3) the random list, which contains 18k random sequence generated by some simple "repeating" heuristic (e.g. "q w z q w z q w z"); 4) the mal list, which contains 500 hand-crafted character sequences that have malicious meaning (e.g. "g o t o h e l l", "h a t e y o u"). The vocabulary size is set to 33, mostly consisting of English characters, and the maximum length of input sequence is set to 6. We train both last-h and attention seq2seq models on the data with

both hidden layer and embedding size set to 200, then enumerate all possible input sequences (336 forward calls to the model), and report the hit rate of each target list in Table 5. Since for this task, we have very good knowledge about the "proper" output behavior of the model (it should only output words in the vocabulary), we also report the number of times an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) sequence is generated.

Table 5: Results by brute-force enumeration, from left to right: perplexity (PPL) of the model on test data, hit rate on all four target list, and the number of times and percentages in all enumeration that the model outputs a character sequence that's OOV.

For both models the hit rate on the normal list is much higher than other lists, which is as expected, and note the interesting result that a large percentage of outputs are OOV, this means even for a task that there 're only very limited number of legitimate outputs, when faced with non-ordinary inputs, the model's generation behavior is not fully predicable. In Table 7, we show some random samples of OOV outputs during brute-force enumeration of the whole input space, the key observation is that they are very similar to English words, except they are not. This demonstrates that seq2seq model's greedy decoding behavior is very close to the "proper" domain.
However, we get zero hit rate on the random and mal lists, and very low hit rate on the reverse list, thus we conjecture that the non-vocab sequences generated by the model could be still very close to the "appropriate" domain (for example, the reverse of a word still looks very much like an English word). These results suggest that the model is pretty robust during greedy decoding, and it could be futile to look for egregious outputs. Thus in our problem formulation (Section 4), we also pay attention to the model's sampling behavior, or the probability mass the model assigns to different kinds of sequences.
It's also interesting to check whether a target sequence appears as a substring in the output, we report substring hit-rates in Table 6. We find that, even if substring hit are considered, the hit rates are still very low, this again, shows the robustness of seq2seq models during greedy decoding.
APPENDIX C AUXILIARY EXPLANATIONS ABOUT HIT TYPES
In this section we provide an alternative view of the notations of the hit types defined in Section 4.1. A hit type is written in this form:
o/io - greedy/sample - avg/min - k1/2 - hit
Here we explain the parts one by one:
· o/io: "o" means that this hit type have no constrain on the trigger input (but it still needs to be a valid sentence), "io" means that the average log-likelihood of the trigger input sequence, when measured by a LM, is required to be larger than a threshold Tin minus log(k).
· greedy/sample: "greedy" means that the model's output via greedy decoding is required to exactly match the target sequence, "sample" means that we instead check the log-likelihood assigned to the target sequence, see "avg/min" below.

· avg/min: "avg/min" is only defined for sample-hit. Respectively, they require the average or minimum log-likelihood of the target sequence to be larger than a threshold Tout minus log(k).
· k1/2: "k" is only defined for sample-hit, and is used to relax the thresholds Tout and Tin by log(k), note that when k is set to 1 (which is the major focus of this work), the threshold doesn't change.
In the writing of this paper, sometimes parts of the hit type specification are omitted for convenience, for example, io-hit refers to hit types in set io-sample-min/avg-k1/2-hit.

APPENDIX D PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS FOR GIBSS-ENUM ALGORITHM
In Figure 4a we show the loss curve of objective function w.r.t different hit types on the normal, mal, random lists for Ubuntu data, the model type is last-h and in is set to 1, note that for clarity, only the target (output) part of the objective function value is shown. The unit used on the x axis is "sweep", which refers to an iteration in the algorithm in which each of the n positions in the input sequence is updated in a one-by-one fashion. The value point on the figure is the average value of objective functions of a mini-batch of 100 targets. It is observed that the optimization procedure quickly converges and there's a large gap in the loss between targets in different lists.
In Figure 4b we run gibbs-enum with different number of random initializations ('r' in the figure), and different enumeration try times G on the Ubuntu normal list for last-h model with in set to zero, and report their corresponding o-greedy-hit rates. It is shown that initially these two hyperparameters both have significant complementary performance gain, but quickly saturate at around 60% hit rate. This implies the gradient information xt (-L(x<t, xt, x>t; y)) can effectively narrow the search space, in our experiments we set G to 100, which is only 1% of |V |.

APPENDIX F AUXILIARY EXPERIMENT RESULTS FOR UBUNTU/SWITCHBOARD/OPENSUBTITLES EXPERIMENTS
F.1 AUXILIARY HIT RATE RESULTS FOR K SET TO 2
Please see Table 11 for sample-hit results with k set to 1 and 2. We observe that the hit rates increase drastically when k is set to 2, this is an alarming result, because it implies the likelihood gap between "proper" and "egregious" outputs is not large. For example, given a trigger input, say you sample T times and get a "proper" response of length L from the model, then when you sample T · 2L times, you will get an egregious response.
F.2 ANALYZING MODEL BEHAVIOR FOR EGREGIOUS OUTPUTS
In Figure 5 we show, on Ubuntu and Switchboard data-sets, word-level negative log-likelihood (NLL) for sample targets in the mal list when its corresponding trigger input is fed, note that several independent target sentences are concatenated together to save space. Attention model is used, and trigger inputs are optimized for io-sample-min-hit. An obvious phenomenon is that the uncommon (egregious) part of the target sentence is assigned with low probability, preventing sample-min-hit. This to some extent demonstrates the robustness of seq2seq models.

F.3 MORE SAMPLES OF HITS FOUND BY THE GIBBS-ENUM ALGORITHM
For more mal trigger input/target pairs found by the gibbs-enum algorithm, see Table 13 for Ubuntu data and Table 14 for Switchboard data. The OpenSubtitles data is special in that it gets non-zero hit rate for o-greedy-hit, and we show them in Table 12.

i 'll find it in the repos : ) thanks for the info .

 i think you are wrong

<unk> : if it 's dns , then that 's what you mean .

 you are wrong .

yes , and yes , but you can try to install it with synaptic
