MONGE-AMPE` RE FLOW FOR GENERATIVE MODELING
Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review
ABSTRACT
We present a deep generative model, named Monge-Ampe`re flow, which builds on continuous-time gradient flow arising from the Monge-Ampe`re equation in optimal transport theory. The generative map from the latent space to the data space follows a dynamical system, where a learnable potential function guides a compressible fluid to flow towards the target density distribution. Training of the model amounts to solving an optimal control problem. The Monge-Ampe`re flow has tractable likelihoods and supports efficient sampling and inference. One can easily impose symmetry constraints in the generative model by designing suitable scalar potential functions. We apply the approach to unsupervised density estimation of the MNIST dataset and variational calculation of the two-dimensional Ising model at the critical point. This approach brings insights and techniques from Monge-Ampe`re equation, optimal transport, and fluid dynamics into reversible flow-based generative models.
1 INTRODUCTION
Generative modeling is a central topic in modern deep learning research Goodfellow et al. (2016) which finds wide applications in image processing, speech synthesis, reinforcement learning, as well as in solving inverse problems and statistical physics problems. The goal of generative modeling is to capture the full joint probability distribution of high dimensional data and generate new samples according to the learned distribution. There have been significant advances in generative modeling in recent years. Of particular interests are the variational autoencoders (VAEs) Kingma & Welling (2013); Rezende et al. (2014), generative adversarial networks (GANs) Goodfellow et al. (2014), and autoregressive models Germain et al. (2015); Kingma et al. (2016); van den Oord et al. (2016b;a); Papamakarios et al. (2017). In addition, there is another class of generative models which has so far gained less attention compared to the aforementioned models. These models invoke a sequence of diffeomorphism to connect between latent variables with a simple base distribution and data which follow a complex distribution. Examples of these flow-based generative models include the NICE and the RealNVP networks Dinh et al. (2014; 2016), and the more recently proposed Glow model Kingma & Dhariwal (2018). These models enjoy favorable properties such as tractable likelihoods and efficient exact inference due to invertibility of the network.
A key concern in the design of flow-based generative models has been the tradeoff between the expressive power of the generative map and the efficiency of training and sampling. One typically needs to impose additional constraints in the network architecture Dinh et al. (2014); Rezende & Mohamed (2015); Kingma et al. (2016); Papamakarios et al. (2017), which unfortunately weakens the model compared to other generative models. In addition, another challenge to generative modeling is how to impose symmetry conditions such that the model generates symmetry related configurations with equal probability.
To further unleash the power of the flow-based generative model, we draw inspirations from the optimal transport theory Villani (2003; 2008); Peyre´ & Cuturi (2018) and dynamical systems Katok & Hasselblatt (1995). Optimal transport theory concerns the problem of connecting two probability distributions p(z) and q(x) via transportation z  x at a minimal cost. In this context, the Brenier theorem Brenier (1991) states that under the quadratic distance measure, the optimal generative map is the gradient of a convex function. This motivates us to parametrize the vector-valued generative map as the gradient of a scalar potential function, thereby formulating the generation process as a continuous-time gradient flow Ambrosio et al. (2008). In this regard, a generative map is naturally viewed as a deterministic dynamical system which evolves over time. Numerical integration

of the dynamical system gives rise to the neural network representation of the generative model. To this end, E (2017) proposes a dynamical system perspective to machine learning, wherein the training procedure is viewed as a control problem, and the algorithm like back-propagation is naturally derived from the optimal control principle LeCun et al. (1988).
In this paper, we devise the Monge-Ampe`re flow as a new generative model and apply it to two problems: density estimation of the MNIST dataset and variational calculation of the Ising model. In our approach, the probability density is modeled by a compressible fluid, which evolves under the gradient flow of a learnable potential function. The flow has tractable likelihoods and exhibits the same computational complexity for sampling and inference. Moreover, a nice feature of the MongeAmpe`re flow is that one can construct symmetric generative models more easily by incorporating the symmetries into the scalar potential. The simplicity and generality of this framework allows the principled design of the generative map and gives rise to lightweight yet powerful generative models.

2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

Consider latent variables z and physical variables x both living in RN . Given a diffeomorphism

between them, x = x(z), the probability densities in the latent and physical spaces are related by

p(z) = q(x) det

x z

. The Brenier theorem Brenier (1991) implies that instead of dealing with

a multi-variable generative map, one can consider a scalar valued generating function x = u(z),

where the convex Brenier potential u satisfies the Monge-Ampe`re equation Caffarelli et al. (1998)

p(z) q(u(z))

=

det

2u zizj

.

(1)

Given the densities p and q, solving the Monge-Ampe`re equation for u turns out to be challenging due to the nonlinearity in the determinant. Moreover, for typical machine learning and statistical physics problems, one faces an additional challenge that one does not even have direct access to both probability densities p and q. Instead, one only has independent and identically distributed samples from one of them, or one only knows one of the distributions up to a normalization constant. Therefore, solving the Brenier potential in these contexts is a control problem instead of a boundary value problem. An additional computational challenge is that even for a given Brenier potential, the right-hand side of equation 1 involves the determinant of the Hessian matrix, which scales unfavorably as O(N 3) with the dimensionality of the problem.

To address these problems, we consider the Monge-Ampe`re equation in its linearized form, where

the transformation is infinitesimal Villani (2003). We write the convex Brenier potential as

u(z) = ||z||2/2 + (z), thus x - z = (z), and correspondingly ln q(x) - ln p(z) =

- Tr ln

I+

2  zi  zj

= - 2(z) + O( 2). In the last equation we expand the logarithmic

function and write the trace of a Hessian matrix as the Laplacian operator. Finally, taking the

continuous-time limit  0, we obtain

dx = (x), dt d ln p(x, t) = -2(x), dt

(2) (3)

such that x(0) = z, p(x, 0) = p(z), and p(x, T ) = q(x), where t denotes continuous-time and T is a fixed time horizon. For simplicity here, we still keep the notion of x, which now depends on time. The evolution of x from time t = 0 to T then defines our generative map.

The two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) compose a dynamical system, which describes the
flow of continuous random variables and the associated probability densities under iterative changeof-variable transformation. To match p(x, T ) and the target density q(x), one can optimize a functional I[p(x, T ), q(x)] that measures the difference between p(x, T ) and q(x). Thus, the training process amounts to solving an optimal control problem for the potential function:

min I[p(x, T ), q(x)].


(4)

As specified later, in our examples I[p(x, T ), q(x)] is defined as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or reverse KL divergence, which give rise to equations (6) and (7), respectively.

The instantaneous velocities of fluid parcels are determined by the gradient of the potential function. The fluid density evolves to the final one after a finite flow time. (b) Numerical integration of the Monge-Ampe`re flow is equivalent to forward passing through a deep residual neural network. Each integration step advances these fluid parcels by one step according to the instantaneous velocity. The density distribution changes accpo(rxd,itn)gly. dp(ixst+th,ett+ota)l number of integration steps.

One can interpret equations (2) and (3) as fluid mechanics equations in the Lagrangian formalism.
Equation (2) describes the trajectory of fluid parcels under the velocity field given by the gradient of the potential function (x). While the time derivative in equation 3 is understood as the "material derivative" Thorne & Blandford (2017), which describes the change of the local fluid density p(x, t) experienced by someone travels with the fluid. Figure 1(a) illustrates the probability flow in a one
dimension example (Appendix A). The velocity field of the given potential pushes the fluid parcel
outward, and the fluid density expands accordingly.

The fluid mechanics interpretation is even more apparent if we write out the material derivative in equation 3 as d/dt = /t + dx/dt · , and use equation 2 to obtain

p(x, t) +  · [p(x, t)v] = 0, t

(5)

which is the continuity equation of a compressible fluid with density p(x, t) and velocity field v = (x). Obeying the continuity equation ensures that the flow conserves the total probability mass. Moreover, the velocity field is curl free  × v  0 and the fluid follows a form of
gradient flow Ambrosio et al. (2008). The irrotational flow matches one's heuristic expectation that
the flow-based generative model transports probability masses.

It should be stressed that although we use the optimal transport theory to motivate model architecture design, i.e., the gradient flow for generative modeling, we do not have to employ the optimal transport objective functions for the control problem in equation 4. The difference is that in generative modeling one typically fixes only one end of the probability density and aims at learning a suitable transformation to reach the other end. While for optimal transport one has both ends fixed and aims at minimizing the transportation cost. References Arjovsky et al. (2017); Bousquet et al. (2017); Genevay et al. (2017) adapted the Wasserstein distances in the optimal transport theory as an objective function for generative modeling.

3 PRACTICAL METHODOLOGY
We parametrize the potential function (x) using a feedforward neural network and integrate the ODEs 2 and 3 to transform the data and their log-likelihoods. Then, by applying the backpropagation algorithm through the ODE integration, we tune the parametrized potential function so that the probability density flows to the desired distribution 1 .
In general, one can represent the potential function in various ways as long as the gradient and Laplacian are well defined. Here we adopt a densely connected neural network with only one hidden

layer in our minimalist implementation. We use the softplus activation function in the hidden layers so that the potential function is differentiable to higher orders. The gradient and the Laplacian of the potential appearing in the right-hand side of equations 2 and 3 can be computed via automatic differentiation.
We integrate equations 2 and 3 using a numerical ODE integrator. At each integration step one advances the ODE system by a small amount, as shown in figure 1. Therefore, the numerical integration of ODE is equivalent to the forward evaluation of a deep residual neural network He et al. (2016); E (2017); Li & Shi (2017); Chang et al. (2017); Lu et al. (2017); Rousseau & Fablet (2018); Ruthotto & Haber (2018); Haber & Ruthotto (2018); Chen et al. (2018). Alternatively, the integration can also be viewed as a recurrent neural network in which one feeds the output back into the block iteratively. In both pictures, the network heavily shares parameters in the depth direction since the gradient and Laplacian information of the same potential function is used in each integration step. As a result, the network is very parameter efficient.
We employ the fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme with a fixed time step , which is set such that the numerical integrator is accurate enough. Thus, the ODE integrator block shown in figure 1(b) contains four layers of neural networks. With a hundred integration steps, the whole ODE integration procedure corresponds to four hundreds layers of a neural network. At the end of the integration, we obtain samples x and their likelihoods ln p(x, T ), which depends on the parametrized potential function (x). Differentiable optimization of such deep neural network is feasible since the integrator only applies small changes to the input signal of each layer.
The deep generative model resulting from the discretization of an ODE system shows some nice features compared to the conventional neural networks. At training time, there is then a tradeoff between the total number of integration steps and the expressibility of the potential function. Longer integration time correspond to a deeper network, thus at each step one just needs to learn a simpler transformation. While at testing time, one can construct a variable depth neural network for the potential function. For example, one can use a larger time step and a smaller number of integration steps for efficient inference. Moreover, by employing a reversible ODE integrator, one can also integrate the equations (2, 3) backward in time with the same computational complexity, and return to the starting point deterministically.
4 APPLICATIONS
We apply the Monge-Ampe`re flow to unsupervised density estimation of an empirical dataset and variational calculation of a statistical mechanics problem. Figure 2 illustrates the schemes of the two tasks. To draw samples from the model and to evaluate their likelihoods, we simulate the fluid dynamics by integrating the ODEs 2 and 3. We use the KL divergence as the measure of dissimilarity between the model probability density and the desired ones. Moreover, we choose the base distribution at time t = 0 to be a simple Gaussian p(x, 0) = N (x). See Appendix C for a summary of the hyperparameters used in the experiments.

4.1 DENSITY ESTIMATION ON THE MNIST DATASET

First we perform the maximum likelihood estimation, which reduces the dissimilarity between the

empirical density distribution (x) of a given dataset and the model density p(x) measured by

the KL-divergence DKL ((x) p(x, T )). It is equivalent to minimize the negative log-likelihood

(NLL):

NLL = -Ex(x)[ln p(x, T )].

about one-tenth of learnable parameters of the MAF model Papamakarios et al. (2017).

The way we carry out density estimation in figure 2(a) is equivalent to transforming the data distribution (x) to the base Gaussian distribution Papamakarios et al. (2017). Figure 3(b) shows the flow from given MNIST images to the Gaussian distribution. One clearly observes that the flow
removes features in the MNIST images in a continuous manner. The procedure is a continuous-time

realization of the Gaussianization technique Chen & Gopinath (2001). Conversely, by integrating the equations forward in time one can use the flow to map Gaussian noises to meaningful images.

an unknown partition function due to its intractability. In practical this amounts to minimizing the

following expectation

(7)

To draw samples from p(x, T ) we start from the base distribution x  p(x, 0) = N (x) and evolve

the samples according to equation 2. We keep track of the likelihoods of these sample by integrating

equation 3 together. The loss function equation 7 provides a variational upper bound to the physical

the objective function employs the reparametrization pathwise derivative for the gradient estimator,

which exhibits low variance and scales to large systems Kingma & Welling (2013).

We apply this variational approach to the Ising model, a prototypical problem in statistical physics. The Ising model exhibits a phase transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state at the critical temperature Onsager (1944). Variational study of the Ising model at the critical point poses a stringent test on the probabilistic model. To predict the thermodynamics accurately, the flow has to capture long-range correlations and rich physics due to the critical fluctuation. In the continuous representation Fisher (1983); Zhang et al. (2012); Li & Wang (2018), the energy function of the Ising model reads (Appendix B)

We set the coupling Kij = (1 + 2)/2 to be at the critical temperature of square lattice Ising

model Onsager (1944), where i, j are nearest neighbors on the square periodic lattice. The expec-

tation inside the bracket of equation 7 is the energy difference between the model and the target

problem. Since one has the force information for both target problem and the network as well, one

can introduce an additional term in the loss function for the force difference Czarnecki et al. (2017);

Zhang et al. (2018a).

The Ising model on a periodic square lattice has a number of symmetries, e.g., the spin inversion
symmetry, the spatial translational symmetry, and the D4 rotational symmetry. Mathematically, the symmetries manifest themselves as an invariance of the energy function E(x) = E(gx), where g
is the symmetry operator that inverts or permutes the physical variables. For physics applications, it

is important to have a generative model that respects these physical symmetries, such that they will generate symmetry-related configurations with equal probability. Although simple symmetries such as the Z2 inversion can be implemented by careful design of the network or simply averaging over the elements in the symmetry group Li & Wang (2018), respecting even more general symmetries in a generative model turns out to be a challenging problem. The Monge-Ampe`re flow naturally solves this problem by imposing the symmetry condition on the scalar potential function since the initial Gaussian distribution respects the maximum symmetry.

There have been a number of studies about how to ensure suitable symmetries in the feedforward

networks in the context of discriminative modeling Zaheer et al. (2017); Han et al. (2018b); Cohen

et al. (2018); Zhang et al. (2018b). Here we employ a simpler approach to encode symmetry in the

generating process. We express the potential as an average over all elements of the symmetry group

consideration

gG ~(gx), where the ~ in each term shares the same network

parameters. At each step of the numerical integration, we sample only one term in the symmetric

average to evaluate the gradient and the Laplacian of the potential. Thus, on average one restores the

required symmetry condition in the generated samples. This is feasible both for training and data

generation since equations 2 and 3 are both linear with respect to the potential function.

Figure 4 shows that the variational loss equation 7 decreases towards the exact solution of the free energy (Appendix B). The achieved accuracy is comparable to the previously reported value using a network which exploits the two-dimensional nature of the problem Li & Wang (2018). The inset shows the directly generated Ising configurations from the network at different training stage. At late stages, the network learned to produce domains of various shapes. One also notices that the generated samples exhibit a large variety of configurations, which respects the physical symmetries. Moreover, the network can estimate log-likelihoods for any given sample which is valuable for the quantitative study of the physical problem. The invertible flow can also perform inverse mapping of the energy function from the physical space to the latent space. Therefore, it can be used to accelerate Monte Carlo simulations, by either recommending the updates as a generative model Huang & Wang (2017); Liu et al. (2017) or performing hybrid Monte Carlo in the latent space Li & Wang (2018).

5 RELATED WORK
Normalizing Flows: The present approach is closely related to the normalizing flows, where one composes bijective and differentiable transformations for generative modeling Rezende & Mohamed (2015). To scale to large dataset it is crucial to make the Jacobian determinant of the transformation efficiently computable. Dinh et al. (2014; 2016); Li & Wang (2018); Kingma & Dhariwal (2018) strive the balance between expressibility and efficiency of the bijective networks by imposing block structures in the Jacobian matrix. Our approach reduces the cubical scaling Hessian determinant to the linear scaling Laplacian calculation by taking the continuous-time limit. The continuous-time gradient flow is more flexible in the network design since bijectivity and the efficiently tractable Jacobian determinant is naturally ensured.
(Inverse) Autoregressive Flows: The autoregressive property could be interpreted as imposing a triangular structure in the Jacobian matrix of the flow to reduce its computational cost. There is a trade-off between the forward and inverse transformation. Therefore, typically the autoregressive flows are used for density estimation Papamakarios et al. (2017), while the inverse autoregressive flows are suitable for posterior in variational inference Kingma et al. (2016). Moreover, these flows are only implicitly reversible, in the sense that the inverse calculation requires solving a nonlinear equation. However, the continuous-time gradient flow has the same time complexity for both the forward and inverse transformation.
Continuous-time diffusive flow: Tabak & Vanden-Eijnden (2010); Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015); Chen et al. (2017); Frogner & Poggio (2018) consider generative models based on diffusion processes. Our work is different since we consider deterministic and reversible advection flow of the fluid. There is, in general, no stochastic force in our simulation (except the random sampling of symmetric functions done in section 4.2). And, we always integrate the flow equation for a finite time interval instead of trying to reach a steady probability density in the asymptotic long time limit.
Dynamical system and control based methods: In a more general perspective, our approach amounts to defining a dynamical system with a target terminal condition, which is naturally viewed

as a control problem E (2017). Along with this direction, Han & E (2016); Han et al. (2018a); Li et al. (2017) offer some insights into interpreting and solving this control problem. Moreover, the Neural ODE Chen et al. (2018) implements an efficient back-propagation scheme through black-box ODE integrators based on adjoint computation, which we did not utilize at the moment.
6 DISCUSSIONS
Gradient flow of compressible fluids in a learnable potential provides a natural way to set up deep generative models. The Monge-Ampe`re flow combines ideas and techniques in optimal transport, fluid dynamics, and differential dynamical systems for generative modeling.
We have adopted a minimalist implementation of the Monge-Ampe`re flow with a scalar potential parameterized by a single hidden layer densely connected neural network. There are a number of immediate improvements to further boost its performance. First, one could extend the neural network architecture of the potential function in accordance with the target problem. For example, a convolutional neural network for data with spatial or temporal correlations. Second, one can explore better integration schemes which exactly respect the time-reversal symmetry to ensure reversible sampling and inference. Lastly, by employing the backpropagation scheme of Chen et al. (2018) through the ODE integrator one can reduce the memory consumption and achieve guaranteed convergence in the integration.
Furthermore, one can employ the Wasserstein distances Arjovsky et al. (2017) instead of the KLdivergence to train the Monge-Ampe`re flow. With an alternative objective function, one may obtain an even more practically useful generative model with tractable likelihood. One may also consider using batch normalization layers during the integration of the flow Dinh et al. (2016); Papamakarios et al. (2017). However, since the batch normalization breaks the physical interpretation of the continuous gradient flow of a fluid, one still needs to investigate whether it plays either a theoretical or a practical significant role in the continuous-time flow.
Moreover, one can use a time-dependent potential (x, t) to induce an even richer gradient flow of the probability densities. Benamou & Brenier (2000) has shown that the optimal transport flow (in the sense of minimizing the spatial-time integrated kinetic energy, which upper bounds the squared Wasserstein-2 distance) follows a pressureless flow in a time-dependent potential. The fluid moves with a constant velocity that linearly interpolates between the initial and the final density distributions. Practically, a time-dependent potential corresponds to a deep generative model without sharing parameters in the depth direction as shown in figure 1(b). Since handling a large number of independent layers for each integration step may be computationally inefficient, one may simply accept one additional time variable in the potential function, or parametrize (x, t) as the solution of another differential equation, or partially tie the network parameters using a hyper-network Ha et al. (2016).
Besides applications presented here, the Monge-Ampe`re flow has wider applications in machine learning and physics problems since it inherits all the advantages of the other flow-based generative models Dinh et al. (2014); Rezende & Mohamed (2015); Kingma et al. (2016); Dinh et al. (2016); Papamakarios et al. (2017). A particular advantage of generative modeling using the Monge-Ampe`re flow is that it is relatively easy to impose symmetry into the scalar potential. It is thus worth exploiting even larger symmetry groups, such as the permutation for modeling exchangeable probabilities Korshunova et al. (2018). Larger scale practical application in statistical and quantum physics is also feasible with the Monge-Ampe`re flow. For example, one can study physical properties of realistic molecular systems using Monge-Ampe`re flow for variational free energy calculation. Lastly, since the mutual information between variables is greatly reduced in the latent space, one can also use the Monge-Ampe`re flow in conjunction with the latent space hybrid Monte Carlo for efficient sampling Li & Wang (2018).

A SOLUTION OF A 1-D GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION

To gain intuition about the probability density flow under the Monge-Ampe`re equation, we work out a close form solution of equations (2, 3) in a one dimensional toy problem.

Since a quadratic potential merely induces scale transformation to the data, a Gaussian distribution

will remain to be a Gaussian with a different variance. Thus, we consider (x) = x2/2, and

p(x, 0) = N (x), and parametrize the time dependent density as p(x, t) = (t) exp
2

-

(t)2 2

x2

,

and (0) = 1. Substitute this ansatz of the time-dependent probability density into equation 3, we

have

- = d ln p(x, t) =  ln p(x, t) + dx  ln p(x, t) dt dt dt x = d ln  - d ln  +  2x2, dt dt

(9)

where we used equation 2, i.e.

dx dt

= x in the second line.

Thus,

d ln  dt

= -, and (t) =

exp(-t). Therefore, under a quadratic potential the fluid parcel moves with acceleration. The

ones that are far away from the origin move faster. And the width of the Gaussian distribution

changes exponentially with time.

B CONTINUOUS FORMULATION OF THE ISING MODEL

The Ising model is a fundamental model in statistical mechanics which allows exact solution in two dimension Onsager (1944). The Ising model partition function reads

ZIsing =

exp

1 sT Ks 2

.

s{±1}N

(10)

To make it amenable to the flow approach we reformulate the Ising problem to an equivalent repre-

sentation in terms of continuous variables following Fisher (1983); Zhang et al. (2012); Li & Wang (2018). First, we offset the coupling to K + I such that all of its eigenvalues are positive, e.g. the minimal eigenvalue of K + I is 0.1. This step does not affect the physical property of the

Ising model except inducing a constant offset in its energies. Next, using the Gaussian integration

trick (Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation) we can decouple the Ising interaction with continu-

ous auxiliary variables ZIsing 

s

dx exp

I )-1 x

.

Finally, tracing out

Ising variables we arrived at the energy function equation 8 for the continuous variables in the main

texts. After solving the continuous version of the Ising problem, one can obtain the original Ising configuration via direct sampling from p(s|x) = i (2xi).

The free energy of the associated continuous representation of the Ising model reads - ln Z =

- ln ZIsing

where

the

of

on

finite periodic lattice can be obtained from Eq. (39) of Kaufman (1949).

C HYPERPARAMETERS
We list the hyperparameters of the network and training in Table 2. in the integration step in the fourth order Runge-Kutta integration. d is the total number of integration steps. Thus T = d is the total integration time. h is the number of hidden neurons in the potential function. B is the mini-batch size for training.
