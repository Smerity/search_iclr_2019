ON TIGHTER GENERALIZATION BOUNDS FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS: CNNS, RESNETS, AND BEYOND
Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review
ABSTRACT
We propose a generalization error bound for a general family of deep neural networks based on the depth and width of the networks, as well as the spectral norm of weight matrices. Through introducing a novel characterization of the Lipschitz properties of neural network family, we achieve a tighter generalization error bound. We further obtain a result that is free of linear dependence on norms for bounded losses. Besides the general deep neural networks, our results can be applied to derive new bounds for several popular architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), residual networks (ResNets), and hyperspherical networks (SphereNets). When achieving same generalization errors with previous arts, our bounds allow for the choice of much larger parameter spaces of weight matrices, inducing potentially stronger expressive ability for neural networks.
1 INTRODUCTION
We aim to provide a theoretical justification for the enormous success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real world applications (He et al., 2016; Collobert et al., 2011; Goodfellow et al., 2016). In particular, our paper focuses on the generalization performance of a general class of DNNs. The generalization bound is a powerful tool to characterize the predictive performance of a class of learning models for unseen data. Early studies investigate the generalization ability of shallow neural networks with no more than one hidden layer (Bartlett, 1998; Anthony & Bartlett, 2009). More recently, studies on the generalization bounds of deep neural networks have received increasing attention (Dinh et al., 2017; Bartlett et al., 2017; Golowich et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2015; 2017). There are two major questions of our interest in these analysis of the generalization bounds:
(Q1) Can we establish tighter generalization error bounds for deep neural networks in terms of the network dimensions and structure of the weight matrices?
(Q2) Can we develop generalization bounds for neural networks with special architectures?
For (Q1), (Neyshabur et al., 2015; Bartlett et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2017; Golowich et al., 2017) have established results that characterize the generalization bounds in terms of the depth D and width p of networks and norms of weight matrices. For example, Neyshabur et al. (2015) provide an exponential bound on D based on the Frobenius norm Wd F, where Wd is the weight matrix of d-th layer; Bartlett et al. (2017); Neyshabur et al. (2017) provide a polynomial bound on p and D based on Wd 2 (spectral norm) and Wd 2,1 (sum of the Euclidean norms for all rows of Wd). Golowich et al. (2017) provide a nearly size independent bound based on Wd F. Nevertheless, the generalization bound depends on other than the spectral norms of the weight matrices may be too loose. In specific, Wd F ( Wd 2,1) is in general p (p) times larger than Wd 2. Given m training data points and suppose Wd 2 = 1 for ease of discussion, Bartlett et al. (2017) and Neyshabur et al. (2017) demonstrate generalization error bounds as O( D3p2/m), and Golowich et al. (2017) achieve a bound O(pD/2 min(m-1/4, D/m)), where O(и) represents the rate by ignoring logarithmic factors. In comparison, we show a tighter generalization error bound as O( Dp2/m), which is significantly smaller than existing results and achieved based on a new Lipschitz analysis for DNNs in terms of both the input and weight matrices. We notice that some recent results characterize the generalization bound in more structured ways, e.g., by considering specific error-resilience parameters (Arora et al., 2018), which can achieve empirically improved generalization bounds than

existing ones based on the norms of weight matrices. However, it is not clear how the weight matrices explicitly control these parameters, which makes the results less interpretable. Thus, we do not compare with these types of results. We summarize the comparison between existing norm based generalization bounds with our results in Table 1, as well as the results when Wd 2 = 1 for more explicit comparison in terms of the network sizes (i.e, depth and width).

For (Q2), we consider several widely used architectures to demonstrate, including convolutional

neural networks (CNNs) (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), residual networks (ResNets) (He et al., 2016),

and hyperspherical networks (SphereNets) (Liu et al., 2017b). By taking their structures of weight

matrices into consideration, we provide tight characterization of their resulting capacities. In partic-

ular, we consider orthogonal filters and normalized weight matrices, which show good performance

in both optimization and generalization (Mishkin & Matas, 2015; Xie et al., 2017). This is closely

related with normalization frameworks, e.g., batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) and layer

normalization (Ba et al., 2016), which have achieved great empirical performance (Liu et al., 2017a;

He et al., 2016). Take CNNs as an example. By incorporating the orthogonal structure of convolu-

tional filters, achieve O

where k is the filter size that satisfies k p and s is stride size that is usually of the same or-

der with k; see Section 4.1 for details. Here we achieve stronger results in terms of both depth D

and width p for CNNs, where our bound only depend on k rather than p. Some recent result achieved

results that is free of the linear dependence on the weight matrix norms by considering networks with

bounded outputs (Zhou & Feng, 2018). We can achieve similar results using bounded loss functions

as discussed in Section 3.2, but do not restrict ourselves to this scenario in general. Analogous

improvement is also attained for ResNets and SphereNets. In addition, we consider some widely

used operations for width expansion and reduction, e.g., padding and pooling, and show that they

do not increase the generalization bound. Further numerical evaluation is provided for quantitative

comparison in Section 4.5.

Our tighter bounds result in potentially stronger expressive power, hence higher training/testing accuracy for the DNNs. In particular, when achieving the same order of generalization errors, we allow the choice of a larger parameter space with deeper/wider networks and larger matrix spectral norms. We further show numerically that a larger parameter space can lead to better empirical performance. Quantitative analysis for the expressive power of DNNs is of great interest on its own, which includes (but not limited to) studying how well DNNs can approximate general class of functions and distributions (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Funahashi, 1989; Barron, 1993; 1994; Lee et al., 2017; Petersen & Voigtlaender, 2017; Hanin & Sellke, 2017), and quantifying the computation hardness of learning neural networks; see e.g., Shamir (2016); Eldan & Shamir (2016); Song et al. (2017). We defer our investigation toward this to future efforts.

Notation. Given an integer n > 0, we define [n] = {1, . . . , n}. Given a vector x  Rp, we denote

xi as the i-th entry, and xi:j as a sub-vector indexed from i-th to j-th entries of x. Given a matrix A  RnОm, we denote Aij as the entry corresponding to i-th row and j-th column, Ai (Ai) as

the i-th row (column), AI1I2 as a submatrix of A indexed by the set of rows I1  [n] and columns

c > 0. We use the standard notations O (и) and  (и) to denote limiting behaviors ignoring constants,

and O (и) and  (и) to further ignore logarithmic factors.

2 PRELIMINARIES

We provide a brief introduction to the generalization error bound; see Kearns & Vazirani (1994); Mohri et al. (2012) for more details. To start with, the output of a class of D-layer neural networks with bounded norm for weight matrices WD = {Wd  RpdОpd-1 }dD=1 is denoted as
FD, и = f (WD, x) = fWD (и и и fW1 (x))  RpD | d  [D], Wd  WD, Wd  Bd , (1)
where x  Rp0 is an input, fWd (y) = d (Wd и y) : Rpd-1  Rpd with an entry-wise activation function d(и), e.g., the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation (Nair & Hinton, 2010) and the sigmoid activation, and {Bd}dD=1 are real positive constants. For ease of discussion, we fix the activation function to be the ReLU throughout this paper. The extension to more general activations, e.g., Lipschitz continuous functions, is straightforward. We will specify the norm и and the corresponding upper bounds Bd, e.g., и 2 and Bd,2, or и F and Bd,F, when necessary.

Then we denote a class of loss functions measuring the discrepancy between a DNN's output f (WD, x) and the corresponding observation y  Ym for a given input x  Xm as

G FD, и = g(f (WD, x) , y)  R | x  Xm, y  Ym, f (и, и)  FD, и , where the sets of bounded inputs Xm and the corresponding observations Ym are Xm = {xi  Rp0 | xi 2  R for all i  [m]}  X and Ym = {yi  [pD] for all i  [m]}  Y. Then the empirical Rademacher complexity (ERC) of G FD, и given Xm and Ym is

Rm G FD, и

=E

{▒1}m gG,f (и,и)FD, и

i и g (f (WD, xi) , yi)

i=1

where {▒1}m  Rm is the set of vectors only containing entries +1 and -1, and with Rademacher entries, i.e., i = +1 or -1 with equal probabilities.

Xm, Ym , (2)  Rm is a vector

Take the classification as an example. For multi-class classification, suppose pD = Nclass is the

number of classes. Consider G with bounded outputs, namely the ramp risk. Specifically, for an

input x belonging to class y  [Nclass], we denote  = (f (WD, x))y - maxi=y (f (WD, x))i. For

a given real value  > 0, the class of ramp

risk functions with parameter  is G FD, и =

g (f (WD, x) , y) |fD  FD, и , where g is

ence, we denote g (f (WD, x) , y) as g (f (WD, x)) (or g) in the rest of the paper.

Then the generalization error bound for PAC learning (Bartlett et al., 2017) (Lemma 3.1) states the
following. Given any real value   (0, 1) and g  G, with probability at least 1 - , we have that the generalization error is upper bounded with respect to (w.r.t.) the ERC of G as

The right hand side of (4) is viewed as a guaranteed error bound for the gap between the testing and
the empirical training performance. Since the ERC is generally the dominating term in (4), a small Rm is desired for DNNs given the loss function G. Analogous results hold for regression tasks; see e.g., Mohri et al. (2012) for details. Analyzing the ERC of DNNs and several popular architectures
in terms of their sizes and weight matrix structures will be the main focus of our paper.

3 GENERALIZATION ERROR BOUND FOR DNNS
Our major focus here is to provide tighter bounds w.r.t. the network sizes based on the spectral norm of weight matrices. A refined result, which is free of the linear dependence on the spectral norm, is provided when the loss function is additionally bounded.

3.1 A TIGHTER ERC BOUND FOR DNNS

We first provide the ERC bound for the class of DNNs defined in (1) and Lipschitz loss functions in

the following theorem. The proof is provided in Appendix A.

For convenience, we treat R/ as a constant here. We achieve O(Dd=1Bd,2 и Dp2/m) in Theorem 1, which is tighter than existing results based on the network sizes and norms of weight

matrices, dence on

exponential depenours. Bartlett et al.

(2017); Neyshabur et al. (2017) demonstrate polynomial dependence on sizes and the spectral norm

of weights, i.e., O(Dd=1Bd,2 и D3p2/m). Our result in (5) is tighter by an order of D, which is significant in practice. Note that p2 may reduce to p in Bartlett et al. (2017); Neyshabur et al. (2017)

when all weight matrices reduce to rank 1. This is a degenerate case as the overall network is reduced

to a rank 1 matrix. Even then, our bound is still tighter if p  D2, which usually holds in practice

for deep networks. More recently, Golowich et al. (2017) demonstrate a bound w.r.t the Frobenius

This

shows a tighter dependence on network sizes. Nevertheless, Wd F is generally p times larger

than Wd 2, which results in an exponential dependence pD/2 compared with the bound based on

the spectral norm. Moreover, log(C1) is linear on D except that the stable ranks Wd F / Wd 2

except when

D = O ( m). Note that our bounded is obtained using a novel characterization of Lipschitz prop-

erties of DNNs, which may be of independent interest from the learning theory point of view. We

refer to Appendix A for detailed analysis.

We also remark that when achieving the same order of generalization errors, our result allows the

choices of larger dimensions (D, p) and spectral norms of weight matrices, which lead to stronger

expressive power for DNNs. For example, when achieving the same bound with Wd 2 = 1 in

spectral norm based results in Golowich et al. (2017)),

(e.g. they

in ours) and Wd F only have Wd 2 =

O=(11/inpF)roinbeFnrioubsennoiurms nboarsmedbaresseudltrses(ue.lgts.,.

The later results in a much smaller space for eligible weight matrices, which may lead to weaker

expressive ability of DNNs. We also demonstrate numerically that when norms of weight matrices

are constrained to be very small, both training and testing performance degrade significantly; see

further discussion in Section 4.5. A quantitative analysis for the tradeoff between the expressive

ability and the generalization for DNNs is deferred to a future effort.

3.2 A SPECTRAL NORM FREE ERC BOUND

When, in addition, the loss function is bounded, we have the ERC bound free of the linear dependence on the spectral norm, as in the following corollary. The proof is provided in Appendix B.

Corollary 1. In addition to the conditions in Theorem 1, suppose we further let the class G be bounded, i.e., |g|  b for all g  G. Then the ERC satisfies

The boundedness of G holds for certain loss functions, e.g., the ramp risk defined in (3). When b

is constant (e.g., b = 1 for the ramp risk) and R

large

compared

we have that the ERC reduces to O( Dp2/m). This is close to the VC dimension of DNNs, which

can be significantly tighter than existing norm based bounds in general. Similar results, which are

free of linear dependence on

D d=1

Bd,2,

are

also

achieved

recently

(Zhou

&

Feng,

2018;

Arora

et al., 2018). However, they are different in the sense that Arora et al. (2018) depend on error-

resilience parameters, such as Jacobian matrices, intermediate layer output and operations, which

are not explicitly interpretable as matrix norms, and Zhou & Feng (2018) study the bound only for

CNNs rather than general DNNs. Similar norm free results hold for the architectures discussed in

Section 4 using argument for Corollary 1, which we skip for ease of discussion.

4 EXPLORING NETWORK STRUCTURES

The generic result in Section 3 does not highlight explicitly the potential impacts for specific structures of the network and weight matrices. In this section, we consider several popular architectures of DNNs, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), residual networks (ResNets) (He et al., 2016), and hyperspherical networks (SphereNets) (Liu et al., 2017b), and provide sharp characterization of the corresponding generalization bounds. In particular, we consider orthogonal filters and normalized weight matrices, which have shown good performance in both optimization and generalization (Mishkin & Matas, 2015; Xie et al., 2017). Such constraints can be enforced using regularizations on filters and weight matrices, which can be very efficient to implement in practice. This is also closely related with normalization approaches, e.g., batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) and layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016), which have achieved tremendous empirical success.

4.1 CNNS WITH ORTHOGONAL FILTERS

CNNs are one of the most powerful architectures in deep learning, especially in tasks related to

images and videos (Goodfellow et al., 2016). We consider a tight characterization of the general-

ization bound for CNNs by generating the weight matrices using orthogonal filters. Specifically, we

generate the weight matrices using a circulant approach, as follows. For the convolutional operation

at the d-th layer, we have nd channels of convolu-

tion filters, each of which is generated from a kd-

dimensional feature using a stride side sd. Sup-

pose that

This is equivalent to fixing the weight matrix at

Since nd  k in our setting, the ERC for CNNs is orthogonal filtered considered in Corollary 2, we

proportional to have Wd F =

lead to the bounds of CNNs in existing results in Table 2. In practice, one usually has kd pd,

which exhibit a significant improvement over existing results, i.e., Dk2

hand, it is widely used in practice that kd = хsd for some small constant х  1 in CNNs, then we have (kd/sd)D/2 pD/2 resulted from Rm G FD, и F .
Remark 1. Corollary 2 demonstrates the generalization bound of CNNs when the input at each layer is a vector. For matrix inputs, e.g., images, similar results hold by consider-

(7) by vectorizing the matrix filters in order to validate the convolution of the filters with all patches

of the matrix input.

Remark 2. A more practical scenario for CNNs is when a network has a few fully connected layers

after the convolutional layers. Suppose we have DC convolutional layers and DF fully connected

layers. From the analysis in Corollary 2, when sd = kd for convolutional layers and Wd 2 = 1 for

fully connected layers, we have that the overall ERC satisfies O

4.2 RESNETS WITH STRUCTURED WEIGHT MATRICES

Residual networks (ResNets) (He et al., 2016) is one of the most powerful architectures that allows

training of tremendously deep networks. Specifically, denote the class of D-layer residual networks

with bounded norms for weight matrices VD =

D d=1

as

FDRN, и = f (VD, UD, x) = fVD,UD (и и и fV1,U1 (x))  RpD Vd  BVd , Ud  BUd , (8)

where fVd,Ud (x) =  (Vd и  (Udx) + x) for all d = 2, . . . , D and fV1,U1 (x) =  (V1 и  (U1x)). We then provide an upper bound of the ERC for ResNets in the following corollary. The proof is

provided in Appendix D.

Compared with the D-layer networks without shortcuts (1), ResNets have a stronger dependence

on the input layer. When

due to the BVd,2 and

shortcuts BUd,2 are

structure, which leads to (BVd of order 1/ D, we still have

,2BUd,2 +

D d=1

(BVd ,2

1) dependence for BUd,2 + 1) = O(1).

each This

partially explains the observation in practice that ResNets have good performance when the weight

matrices have relatively small scales. Also note that to achieve the same bound for Rm G FDRN, и F , we require BVd,F, BUd,F  c, which leads to a much smaller parameter space than the space corresponding to BVd,2, BUd,2  c for the same c.

4.3 HYPERSPHERICAL NETWORKS

We also consider the hyperspherical networks (SphereNets) (Liu et al., 2017b), which demonstrate improved performance than the vanilla DNNs. In specific, the class of D-layer SphereNets is

FDSN, и = f WD, x = fWD и и и fW1 (x)  RpD Wd  BWd ,

(9)

where fWd (x) =  Wdx for all d  [D]. Here, Wd = SWd Wd, where SWd is a diagonal matrix with the i-th diagonal entries being the Euclidean norm of the i-th row of Wd. Note that we do

not normalize the input x as in (Liu et al., 2017b) for ease of the discussion. A direct result of

applying Theorem 1 to (9) implies that Rm G FDSN, и 2

=O

Rи

D d=1

BWd ,2 и

m

Dp2

. Such a self-

normalization architecture has a benefit that BWd,2 is small (close to 1) in general when the weights

are spread out. In addition, it has lower computational costs than the weight normalization based on

the spectral norm directly, and effective empirical results have been observed (Liu et al., 2017b;a).

4.4 EXTENSION TO WIDTH-CHANGE OPERATIONS

Change the width for certain layers is a widely used operation, e.g., for CNNs and ResNets, which can be viewed as a linear transformation in many cases. In specific, denote x{d}  Rpd as the output of the d-th layer. Then we can use a transformation matrix Td  Rpd+1Оpd to denote the operation to change the dimension between the output of the d-th layer and the input of the (d + 1)-th layer
as fWd+1 x{d} =  Wd+1Tdx{d} . Denote the set of layers with width changes by IT  [D]. Combining with Theorem 1, we have that the ERC satisfies

Rm G FD, и 2

= O R и Dd=1Bd,2 и tIT Tt 2 и m

Dp2

.

(10)

Next, we illustrate several popular examples to show that tIT Tt 2 is a size independent constant. We refer to Goodfellow et al. (2016) for more operations of changing the width.

Width Expansion. Two popular types of width expansion are padding and 1 О 1 convolution. For
ease of discussion, suppose pd+1 = s и pd for some positive integer s  1. Taking padding with 0 as an example, where we plug in (s - 1) zeros before each entry of x{d}, which is equivalent to setting Td  RspdОpd with (Td)ij = 1 if i = js, and (Td)ij = 0 otherwise. This implies that Td 2 = 1.

For 1 О 1 convolution, suppose that the convolution features are {c1, . . . , cs}. Then we expand

width by performing convolution (essentially entry-wise product) using s features respectively. This

is equivalent to setting Td  RspdОpd with (Td)ij = ck if i = j +(k-1)s for k  [s], and (Td)ij = 0

otherwise. It implies that Td 2 =

s i=1

c2i .

When

s i=1

ci2



1,

we

have

Td

2  1.

Width Reduction. Two popular types of width reduction are average pooling and max pooling.

Suppose pd+1

=

pd s

is an

integer

for some positive

integer

s.

For

average pooling,

we

pool

each

nonoverlapping

s

into

one

feature.

This

is

equivalent

to

setting

Td



R pd s

Оpd

with

(Td)ij

=

1/s if j = (i - 1)s + k for k  [s], and (Td)ij = 0 otherwise. This implies that Td 2 = 1/s.

For max pooling, we choose the largest entry in each nonoverlapping feature segment of length s.

Denote the set Is

=

{(i - 1) О s + 1, . . . , i и s}.

This is equivalent

to setting Td



R pd s

Оpd

with

(Td)ij = 1 if |(x{d})j|  |(x{d})k|  k  Is, k = j, and (Td)ij = 0 otherwise. This implies that

Td 2 = 1. For pooling with overlapping features, similar results hold.

4.5 NUMERICAL EVALUATION

To better illustrate the difference between our result and existing ones, we demonstrate some com-

parison results in Figure 1 using real data. In specific, we train a simplified VGG19-net (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) using 3 О 3 convolution fil-

Figure 1: Panel (a) shows comparison results for the same VGG19 network trained on CIFAR10 using unit norm filters. The vertical axis is the logarithmic scale of the corresponding bounds. Panel (b) shows the training accuracy (red diamond), testing accuracy (blue cross), and the empirical generalization error using different scales of the filters listed on the horizontal axes.

Note that we do not compare with (Zhou & Feng, 2018; Arora et al., 2018) since we are interested in results with explicit dependence on weight matrix structure (i.e., norms), without further restriction on the network (e.g., bounded activation). Moreover, since we may have more filters nd than their dimension k, we do not assume orthogonality here. Thus we simply use the upper bounds of norms

Bd rather than the form as in Table 2. Following the analysis of Theorem 1, we have

Dp2 as k

D d=1

where

is the number of filters at d-th layer.

For the same network and corresponding weight matrices, we see from Figure 1 (a) that our result

(104  105) is significantly smaller than Bartlett et al. (2017); Neyshabur et al. (2017) (108  109)

and Golowich et al. (2017) (1014  1015). As we have discussed, our bound benefits from tighter

dependence on the dimensions. Note that k

in

Neyshabur et al. (2017) (both are of order D3p2). In addition, this verifies that spectral dependence

is significantly tighter than Frobenius norm dependence in Golowich et al. (2017). Further, we show

the training accuracy, testing accuracy, and the empirical generalization error using different scales

on the norm of the filters in Figure 1 (b). We see that the generalization errors decrease when the

norm of filters decreases. However, note that when the norms are too small, the accuracies drop

significantly due to a potentially much smaller parameter space. Thus, the scales (norms) of the

weight matrices should be nether too large (induce large generalization error) nor too small (induce

low accuracy) and choosing proper scales is important in practice as existing works have shown. On

the other hand, this also support our claim that when Rm G FD, и F (or other existing bound) attains the same order with our Rm G FD, и 2 , we have better training/testing performance.

5 DISCUSSION

Our investigation on the generalization bound establishes that the spectral norm is a tighter charac-

terization for the norm based analysis of the ERC on DNNs, compared with other norms (e.g., Frobe-

nius norm). This is also closely related the efficient optimization of DNNs. For example, effective

initializations generally require the spectral norms (rather than the Frobenius norm) of weight matri-

ces to be approximately constant (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). Therefore, properly choosing the struc-

ture of weight matrices can significantly affect both generalization and optimization performance

of DNNs, as is observed in various applications (Goodfellow et al., 2016). On the other hand, the

lower bound in Golowich et al. (2017) states that Rm G FD, и 2

=  Rи

implies that further improvement maybe achievable.

A PROOF OF THEOREM 1
Our analysis is based on the characterization of the Lipschitz property of a given function on both input and parameters. Such an idea can potentially provide tighter bound on the model capacity in terms of these Lipschitz constants and the number of free parameters, including other architectures of DNNs. We first provide an upper bound for the Lipschitz constant of f (WD, x) in terms of the input x. Lemma 1. Given WD, for any f (WD, и)  FD, и 2 and x1, x2  Rp0 , we have
D
f (WD, x1) - f (WD, x2) 2  x1 - x2 2 и Bd.
d=1
Proof. We prove by induction. Specifically, we have
f (WD, x1) - f (WD, x2) 2 =  (WDf (WD-1, x1)) -  (WDf (WD-1, x2)) 2
(i)
 WDf (WD-1, x1) - WDf (WD-1, x2) 2  WD 2 и f (WD-1, x1) - f (WD-1, x2) 2  BD и f (WD-1, x1) - f (WD-1, x2) 2 ,
where (i) comes from the entry-wise 1ГLipschitz continuity of (и). For the first layer, we have
f (W1, x1) - f (W1, x2) 2 =  (W1x1) -  (WDx2) 2  W1x1 - W1x2 2  B1 и x1 - x2 2 .
By repeating the argument above, we complete the proof.

Next, we provide an upper bound for the Lipschitz constant of f (WD, x) in terms of the parameters WD .

Lemma 2. Given any x  Rp0 satisfying x 2  R, for any f (WD, x) , f

Then we provide an upper bound for the ERC of a class of function that is Lipschitz on both param-

eters and input based on the number of parameters of DNNs.

Lemma 3. Suppose g(w, x) is Lw-Lipschitz over w  Rh with w 2  K and  =

Rm (G) = O

Proof. For any w, w  Rh and x, we have

 (g1, g2) = |g1(x) - g2(x)| = |g (w, x) - g (w, x)|  Lw w - w 2 .

(13)

Since g is a parametric function with h parameters, then we have the covering number of G under

the metric  in (13) satisfies

N (G, , )

Then using the standard Dudley's entropy integral bound on the ERC (Mohri et al., 2012), we have

We first show that using unit norm filters for all d  [D] and nd  kd, we have

Wd 2 =

(16)

First note that when nd = kd, due to the orthogonality of

D PROOF OF COROLLARY 3

The analysis is analogous to the proof for Theorem 1, but with different construction of the intermediate results. We omit  for ease of discussion. We first provide an upper bound for the Lipschitz constant of f (VD, UD, x) in terms of x. Lemma 4. Given VD and UD, for any f (VD, UD, и)  FD, и 2 and x1, x2  Rp0 , we have
f (VD, UD, x1) - f (VD, UD, x2) 2  x1 - x2 2 и Dd=1 (dBUd,2BVd,2 + 1) . (20)

Proof. Consider the ResNet layer, for any x1, x2  Rk, we have
f (VD, UD, x1) - f (VD, UD, x2) 2 = fVD,UD (и и и fV1,U1 (x1)) - fVD,UD (и и и fV1,U1 (x2)) 2 =  DVD и  UD и fVD-1,UD-1 (и и и fV1,U1 (x1)) + fVD-1,UD-1 (и и и fV1,U1 (x1))

 (D VD 2 UD 2 + 1) и fVD-1,UD-1 (и и и fV1,U1 (x1)) - fVD-1,UD-1 (и и и fV1,U1 (x2)) 2 ,

E SPECTRAL BOUND FOR Wd IN CNNS WITH MATRIX FILTERS

We provide further discussion on the upper bound of the spectral norm for the weight matrix Wd in CNNs with matrix filters. In particular, by denoting Wd using submatrices as in (6), i.e.,

Wd = Wd(1) и и и Wd(nd)

we have that each block matrix Wd(j) is of the form





Wd(j)
