STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION OF SORTING NETWORKS VIA CONTINUOUS RELAXATIONS
Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review
ABSTRACT
Sorting input objects is an important step within many machine learning pipelines. However, the sorting operator is non-differentiable w.r.t. its inputs, which prohibits end-to-end gradient-based optimization. In this work, we propose a generalpurpose continuous relaxation of the output of the sorting operator from permutation matrices to the set of unimodal matrices. Further, we use this relaxation to enable more efficient stochastic optimization over the combinatorially large space of permutations. In particular, we derive a reparameterized gradient estimator for the widely used Plackett-Luce family of distributions. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework on three tasks that require learning semantic orderings of high-dimensional objects.
1 INTRODUCTION
In machine learning, learning to automatically sort objects is useful in many applications, such as top-k losses for classification (Berrada et al., 2018), ranking documents for information retrieval (Liu et al., 2009), and multi-object target tracking in computer vision (Bar-Shalom & Li, 1995). Many such algorithms involve learning permutations of complex, high-dimensional objects, e.g., images. Such algorithms typically require learning informative representations of data prior to sorting and subsequent downstream processing. For instance, the k-nearest neighbors image classification algorithm, which orders the neighbors based on distances in the canonical pixel basis, can be highly suboptimal for classification. While gradient-based optimization methods for deep neural networks excel at representation learning, the non-differentiability of sorting w.r.t. the input representations makes it challenging to use the sort operator in conjunction with automatic differentiation tools.
In this work, we propose a relaxation to the sorting operator that is continuous everywhere and differentiable almost everywhere w.r.t. the inputs. The outcome of any sorting algorithm can be viewed as a permutation matrix, which is a square matrix with 0/1 entries such that every row and every column sums to 1. We propose a continuous relaxation of permutation matrices onto the set of unimodal row stochastic matrices. The relaxation includes a temperature knob that controls the degree of approximation, recovering a permutation matrix in the limit of zero temperature. Besides every row summing to 1, unimodal matrices additionally can be transformed to a permutation matrix that sorts the inputs by simply taking the arg max within each row. Hence, such matrices are also suitable for efficient straight-through gradient optimization (Bengio et al., 2013) that require "hard" permutation matrices for evaluating learning objectives during the forward pass.
Our second contribution extends the use of the proposed deterministic sorting relaxation to stochastic optimization over permutations. In many cases, such as latent variable models, the permutations may not be directly observed. By allowing for distributions over permutations, we can account for the uncertainty due to the unobserved permutations in a principled manner. However, the challenge with including stochastic nodes over discrete objects lies in gradient estimation with respect to the parameters of the discrete distribution. Vanilla REINFORCE estimators are impractical for most cases, or necessitate custom control variates for low-variance gradient estimation (Glasserman, 2013; Schulman et al., 2015).
In this regard, we consider the Plackett-Luce (PL) family of distributions over permutations (Plackett, 1975; Luce, 1959), a common modeling choice for ranking models. Appealingly, we can also derive a reparameterizable sampler for stochastic optimization with respect to this distribution, based on Gumbel perturbations to the distribution parameters. The reparameterized sampler, however requires a sorting operation which makes the objective non-differentiable w.r.t. these parameters. Our

proposed continuous relaxation to sorting allows us to approximate the objective and obtain welldefined reparameterized gradient estimates.
Finally, we apply this framework to tasks that require us to learn semantic orderings of the complex, high-dimensional input data. First, we consider sorting of images of handwritten digits, where the goal is to learn to sort images by their unobserved labels. Our second task extends the first one to identifying the 50-th quantile (a.k.a. the median) of a set of handwritten numbers. In addition to identifying the index of the median image in the sequence, we need to learn to map the inferred median digit to its scalar representation. In the third task, we propose an algorithm that learns a basis representation for the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier in an end-to-end procedure. Because the choice of the k nearest neighbors requires a non-differentiable sorting, we use our relaxation to obtain an approximate, differentiable surrogate. On all tasks, we observe significant empirical improvements over the competing benchmarks.

2 PRELIMINARIES

An n-dimensional permutation z = [z1, z2, . . . , zn]T is a list of unique indices {1, 2, . . . , n}. Every permutation z is associated with a permutation matrix Pz  {0, 1}nОn with entries given as:

Pz[i, j] =

1 if j = zi 0 otherwise.

Let Zn denote the set of all possible n! permutations in the symmetric group. We define the sort : Rn  Zn operator as a mapping of n real-valued inputs to a permutation corresponding to a descending ordering of these inputs. E.g., if the input vector s = [9, 1, 5, 2]T , then sort(s) = [1, 3, 4, 2]T since the largest element is at the first index, second largest element is at the third index and so on. In case of ties, elements are assigned indices in the order they appear. We can obtain the sorted vector simply via Psort(s)s.

2.1 PLACKETT-LUCE DISTRIBUTIONS

The family of Plackett-Luce distributions over permutations is best described via a generative process: Consider a sequence of n items, each associated with a canonical index i = 1, 2, . . . , n. A
common assumption in ranking models is that the underlying generating process for any observed permutation of n items satisfies Luce's choice axiom (Luce, 1959). Mathematically, this axiom defines the `choice' probability of an item with index i as: q(i)  si where si > 0 is interpreted as the score of item with index i. The normalization constant is given by Z = i{1,2,...,n} si.

If we choose the n items one at a time (without replacement) based on these choice probabilities,

we obtain a discrete distribution over all possible permutations. This distribution is referred to as

the Plackett-Luce (PL) distribution, and its probability mass function for any z  Zn is given by:

q(z|s) =

sz1 sz2 Z Z - sz1

иии Z-

szn

n-1 i=1

szi

(1)

where s = {s1, s2, . . . , sn} is the vector of scores parameterizing this distribution (Plackett, 1975).

2.2 STOCHASTIC COMPUTATION GRAPHS
The abstraction of stochastic computation graphs (SCG) compactly specifies the forward value and the backward gradient computation for computational circuits. An SCG is a directed acyclic graph that consists of three kinds of nodes: input nodes which specify external inputs (including parameters), deterministic nodes which are deterministic functions of their parents, and stochastic nodes which are distributed conditionally on their parents. See Schulman et al. (2015) for a review.
To define gradients of an objective function w.r.t. any node in the graph, the chain rule necessitates that the gradients w.r.t. the intermediate nodes are well-defined. This is not the case for the sort operator. In Section 3, we will propose to extend stochastic computation graphs with nodes corresponding to a relaxation of the deterministic sort operator. In Section 4, we will further use this relaxation to extend computation graphs to include stochastic nodes corresponding to distributions over permutations. The proofs of all theoretical results in this work are deferred to Appendix B.

3 THE RELAXED SORTING OPERATOR

Our goal in this section is to derive surrogates to the sort operator that have well-defined gradients w.r.t. the inputs. The general recipe to relax non-differentiable operators with discrete codomains N is to consider differentiable alternatives that map the input to a larger continuous codomain M with desirable properties. For gradient-based optimization, we are interested in two key properties:
1. The relaxation is continuous everywhere and differentiable (almost-)everywhere with respect to elements in the input domain.
2. There exists a computationally efficient projection from M to N .
Relaxations satisfying the first requirement are amenable to the powerful machinery of automatic differentiation for optimizing stochastic computational graphs. The second requirement is useful for evaluating metrics and losses that necessarily require a discrete output akin to the one obtained from the original, non-relaxed operator. E.g., in straight-through gradient estimation (Bengio et al., 2013; Jang et al., 2017), the non-relaxed operator is used for evaluating the learning objective in the forward pass and the relaxed operator is used in the backward pass for gradient estimation.
The canonical example is the 0/1 loss used for binary classification. While the 0/1 loss is discontinuous w.r.t. real-valued model predictions, surrogates such as the logistic and hinge losses used for logistic regression and support vector machines respectively are continuous everywhere and differentiable (almost-)everywhere, and can give hard binary predictions via thresholding.
Note: For brevity, we assume that the arg max operator is applied over a set of elements with a unique maximizer and hence, the operator has well-defined semantics. With some additional bookkeeping for resolving ties, the results in this section hold even if the elements are not unique. See Appendix C.

Unimodal Row Stochastic Matrices. The sort operator maps the input vector to a permutation, or equivalently a permutation matrix. Our relaxation to sort is motivated by the geometric structure of permutation matrices. The set of permutation matrices is a subset of doubly stochastic matrices, which allow for arbitrary non-negative matrix entries such that the every row and column sums to one. If we remove the requirement that every column should sum to one, we obtain a larger set of row stochastic matrices. In this work, we propose a relaxation to sort that maps inputs to an alternate subset of row stochastic matrices, which we refer to as the unimodal row stochastic matrices.
Definition 1 (Unimodal Row Stochastic Matrices). An n О n matrix is Unimodal Row Stochastic if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. Non-negativity: U [i, j]  0 i, j  {1, 2, . . . , n}.

2. Row Affinity:

n j=1

U

[i,

j]

=

1

i  {1, 2, . . . , n}.

3. Argmax Permutation: Let u denote an n-dimensional vector with entries such that ui = arg maxj U [i, j] i  {1, 2, . . . , n}. Then, u  Zn.

We denote Un as the set of n О n unimodal row stochastic matrices.

All row stochastic matrices satisfy the first two conditions. The third condition is useful for gradient based optimization involving sorting based losses. The condition provides a straightforward mechanism for extracting a permutation from a unimodal row stochastic matrix via a row-wise arg max operation. Figure 1 shows the relationships between the different subsets of square matrices.

Sorting Relaxation. Our relaxation to the sort operator is based on a standard identity for evaluating the sum of the k largest elements in any input vector.
Lemma 2. [Lemma 1 in Ogryczak & Tamir (2003)] For an input vector s = [s1, s2, . . . , sn]T that is sorted as s[1]  s[2]  . . .  s[n], we have the sum of the k-largest elements given as:

kn

s[i] = min k + max(si - , 0).

i=1

{s1 ,s2 ,...,sn }

i=1

(2)

The identity in Lemma 2 outputs the sum of the top-k elements. The k-th largest element itself can be recovered by taking the difference of the sum of top-k elements and the top-(k - 1) elements.
Corollary 3. Let s = [s1, s2, . . . , sn]T be a real-valued vector of length n. Let As denote the matrix of absolute pairwise differences of the elements of s such that As[i, j] = |si - sj|. The permutation matrix Psort(s) corresponding to sort(s) is given by:

Psort(s)[i, j] =

1 if j = arg max[(n + 1 - 2i)s - As1] 0 otherwise

(3)

where 1 denotes the column vector of all ones.

E.g., if we set i = (n + 1)/2 then the non-zero entry in the i-th row Psort(s)[i, :] corresponds to the element with the minimum sum of (absolute) distance to the other elements. As desired, this corresponds to the median element. The relaxation requires O(n2) operations to compute As, as opposed to the O(n log n) overall complexity for the best known comparator based sorting algorithms.
In practice however, it is highly parallelizable and can be implemented efficiently on GPU hardware.

The arg max operator is non-differentiable which prohibits the direct use of Corollary 3 for gradient computation. Instead, we propose to replace the arg max operator with soft max to obtain a
continuous relaxation Psort(s)( ). In particular, the i-th row of Psort(s)( ) is given by:

Psort(s)[i, :]( ) = soft max [((n + 1 - 2i)s - As1)/ ]

(4)

where  > 0 is a temperature parameter. Our relaxation is continuous everywhere and differentiable almost everywhere with respect to the elements of s. Furthermore, we have the following result.

Theorem 4. Let Psort(s) denote the continuous relaxation to the permutation matrix Psort(s) for an arbitrary input vector s and temperature  . Then, we have:

1. Unimodality:  > 0, Psort(s) is a unimodal row stochastic matrix. Further, let u denote the permutation obtained by applying arg max row-wise to Psort(s). Then, u = sort(s).

2. Limiting behavior: If we assume that the entries of s are drawn independently from a distribution that is absolutely continuous w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure in R, then the following convergence holds almost surely:

lim Psort(s)[i, :]( ) = Psort(s)[i, :] i  {1, 2, . . . , n}.
 0+

(5)

Unimodality allows for efficient projection of the relaxed permutation matrix Psort(s) to the hard matrix Psort(s) via a row-wise arg max, e.g., for straight-through gradients. For analyzing limiting behavior, independent draws ensure that the elements of s are distinct almost surely. The temperature
 controls the degree of smoothness of our approximation. At one extreme, the approximation
becomes tighter as the temperature is reduced. In practice however, the trade-off is in the variance
of these estimates, which is typically lower for larger temperatures.

4 STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION OVER PERMUTATIONS

In many scenarios, we would like the ability to specify stochastic nodes corresponding to distributions over permutations in our computation graph, e.g., latent variable models with latent nodes corresponding to permutation matrices. Consider the following stochastic optimization objective:

L(, s) = Eq(z;s) [f (Pz; , s)]

where  and s denote sets of parameters, Pz is the permutation matrix corresponding to the permutation z, q(и) is a parameterized distribution over the elements of the symmetric group Zn, and f (и) is an arbitrary function of interest assumed to be differentiable in  and z. While such objectives are
typically intractable to evaluate exactly since they require summing over a combinatorially large set,
we can obtain unbiased estimates efficiently via Monte Carlo. The SCG is shown in Figure 2a.

Monte Carlo estimates of gradients w.r.t.  can be derived simply via linearity of expectation. The

gradient estimates w.r.t. s cannot be obtained directly since the sampling distribution depends on

s. The REINFORCE gradient estimator (Glynn, 1990; Williams, 1992; Fu, 2006) uses the fact that

sq(z; s) = q(z; s)s log q(z; s) to derive the following Monte Carlo gradient estimates:

sL(, s) = Eq(z;s) [f (Pz; , s)s log q(z; s)] + Eq(z;s) [sf (Pz; , s)] .

4.1 REPARAMETERIZED GRADIENT ESTIMATORS FOR PL DISTRIBUTIONS

REINFORCE gradient estimators typically suffer from high variance (Schulman et al., 2015; Glasserman, 2013). Reparameterized samplers provide an alternate gradient estimator by expressing samples from a distribution as a deterministic function of its parameters and a fixed source of randomness (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014; Titsias & La┤zaro-Gredilla, 2014). Since the randomness is from a fixed distribution, Monte Carlo gradient estimates can be derived by pushing the gradient operator inside the expectation (via linearity). In this section, we will derive a reparameterized sampler and gradient estimator for the Plackett-Luce (PL) family of distributions.

Let the score si for an item i  {1, 2, . . . , n} be an unobserved random variable drawn from some underlying score distribution (Thurstone, 1927). Now for each item, we draw a score from its corresponding score distribution. Next, we generate a permutation by applying the deterministic sort operator to these n randomly sampled scores. Interestingly, prior work has shown that the resulting distribution over permutations corresponds to a PL distribution if and only if the scores are sampled independently from Gumbel distributions with identical scales.

Proposition 5. [adapted from Yellott Jr (1977)] Let s be a vector of scores for the n items. For each

item i, sample gi  Gumbel(0, ) independently with zero mean and a fixed scale . Let ~s denote

the vector of Gumbel perturbed log-scores with entries such that s~i =  log si + gi. Then:

q(s~z1  и и и  s~zn ) =

sz1 sz2 Z Z - sz1

иии Z-

szn
n-1 i=1

szi

.

(8)

For ease of presentation, we assume  = 1 in the rest of this work. Proposition 5 provides a method for sampling from PL distributions with parameters s by adding Gumbel perturbations to the logscores and applying the sort operator to the perturbed log-scores. This procedure can be seen as a reparameterization trick that expresses a sample from the PL distribution as a deterministic function of the scores and a fixed source of randomness (Figure 2b). Letting g denote the vector of i.i.d. Gumbel perturbations, we can express the objective in Eq. 6 as:

L(, s) = Eg f (Psort(log s+g); , s) .

(9)

While the reparameterized sampler removes the dependence of the expectation on the parameters

s, it introduces a sort operator in the computation graph such that the overall objective is non-

differentiable in s. In order to obtain a differentiable surrogate, we approximate the objective based

on the continuous relaxation to the sort operator proposed previously:

Eg f (Psort(log s+g); , s)  Eg f (Psort(log s+g); , s) := L(, s).

(10)

Accordingly, we get the following reparameterized gradient estimates for the approximation:

sL(, s) = Eg sf (Psort(log s+g); , s)

(11)

which can be estimated efficiently via Monte Carlo.

5 DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
The problem of learning to rank documents based on relevances has been studied extensively in the context of information retrieval. In particular, the listwise approaches learn functions that map objects to scores. Much of this work concerns the PL distribution: the RankNet algorithm (Burges et al., 2005) can be interpreted as maximizing the PL likelihood of pairwise comparisons between items, while the ListMLE ranking algorithm in Xia et al. (2008) extends this with a loss that maximizes the PL likelihood of ground-truth permutations directly. The differentiable pairwise approaches to ranking, such as Rigutini et al. (2011), learn to approximate the comparator between pairs of objects. Our work considers a generalized setting where sorting based operators can be inserted anywhere in computation graphs to extend traditional algorithmic pipelines e.g., kNN.
Recent works have proposed relaxations of permutation matrices to the Birkhoff polytope, which is defined as the set of doubly stochastic matrices (Adams & Zemel, 2011; Mena et al., 2018; Linderman et al., 2018). Adams & Zemel (2011) proposed the use of the Sinkhorn operator to map any square matrix to the Birkhoff polytope. They interpret the resulting doubly-stochastic matrix as the marginals of a distribution over permutations. Mena et al. (2018) propose an alternate method where the square matrix defines a latent distribution over the doubly-stochastic matrices themselves. These distributions can be sampled from by adding elementwise Gumbel perturbations. Linderman et al. (2018) propose a rounding procedure that uses the Sinkhorn operator to directly sample matrices near the Birkhoff polytope. Unlike Mena et al. (2018), the resulting distribution over matrices has a tractable density. In practice, however, the approach of Mena et al. (2018) performs better and will be the main baseline we will be comparing against in our experiments in Section 6.
As discussed in Section 3, our relaxation maps permutation matrices to the set of unimodal row stochastic matrices. For the stochastic setting, the PL distribution permits efficient sampling, exact and tractable density estimation, making it an attractive choice for several applications, e.g., variational inference over latent permutations. Our reparameterizable sampler, while also making use of the Gumbel distribution, is based on a result unique to the PL distribution (Proposition 5).
The use of the Gumbel distribution for defining continuous relaxations to discrete distributions was first proposed concurrently by Jang et al. (2017) and Maddison et al. (2017) for categorical variables, referred to as Gumbel-Softmax. The number of possible permutations grow factorially with the dimension, and thus any distribution over n-dimensional permutations can be equivalently seen as a distribution over n! categories. Gumbel-softmax does not scale to a combinatorially large number of categories, necessitating the use of alternate relaxations, such as the one considered in this work.
6 EXPERIMENTS
We refer to the two approaches proposed in Sections 3, 4 as Deterministic Sortnet and Stochastic Sortnet, respectively. For additional hyperparameter details and analysis, see Appendix D.
6.1 SORTING HANDWRITTEN NUMBERS
Dataset. We create the large-MNIST dataset, which extends the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The dataset consists of multi-digit images, each a concatenation of randomly selected individual images from MNIST. Figure 3a shows an example sequence of 5 such images.
Setup. We are given a dataset of sequences. Each sequence contains n images, and each image corresponds to an integer label. Our goal is to learn to predict the permutation that sorts these labels, given a training set of ground-truth permutations, e.g., Figure 3b. This task is a challenging extension of the one considered by Mena et al. (2018) in sorting scalars, since it involves learning the semantics of high-dimensional objects prior to sorting. A good model needs to learn to dissect the individual digits in an image, rank these digits, and finally, compose such rankings based on the digit positions within an image. The available supervision, in the form of the ground-truth permutation, is very weak compared to a classification setting that gives direct access to the image labels.

Baselines. All baselines use a CNN that is shared across all images in a sequence to map each large-MNIST image to a feature space. The vanilla row stochastic (RS) baseline concatenates the CNN representations for n images into a single vector that is fed into a multilayer perceptron that outputs n multiclass predictions of the image probabilities for each rank. The Sinkhorn and GumbelSinkhorn baselines, as discussed in Section 5, use the Sinkhorn operator to map the stacked CNN representations for the n objects into a doubly stochastic matrix. For all methods, we minimized the cross-entropy loss between the predicted matrix and the ground-truth permutation matrix.
Results. Following Mena et al. (2018), our evaluation metric is the the proportion of correctly predicted permutations on a test set of sequences. Additionally, we evaluate the proportion of individual elements ranked correctly. Table 1 demonstrates that the approaches based on the proposed sorting relaxation significantly outperform the baseline approaches for all n considered. The performance of the deterministic and stochastic variants are comparable. The vanilla RS baseline performs well in ranking individual elements, but is not good at recovering the overall square matrix.
We believe the poor performance of the Sinkhorn baselines is partly since these methods were designed and evaluated for matchings. Like the output of sort, matchings can also be represented as permutation matrices. However, distributions over matchings need not satisfy Luce's choice axiom or imply a total ordering, which could explain the poor performance on the tasks considered.

6.2 QUANTILE REGRESSION
Setup. In this experiment, we extend the sorting task to regression. Again, each sequence contains n large-MNIST images, and the regression target for each sequence is the 50-th quantile (i.e., the median) of the n labels of the images in the sequence. Figure 3c illustrates this task for one such sequence and n = 5. The design of this task highlights two key challenges since it explicitly requires learning both a suitable representation for sorting high-dimensional inputs and a secondary function that approximates the label itself (regression). Again, the supervision available in the form of the label of only a single image at an arbitrary and unknown location in the sequence is very weak.
Baselines. In addition to Sinkhorn and Gumbel-Sinkhorn, we design two more baselines. The Constant baseline always returns the median of the full range of possible outputs, ignoring the input sequence. This corresponds to 4999.5 since we are sampling large-MNIST images uniformly in the range of four-digit numbers. The vanilla neural net (NN) baseline directly maps the input sequence of images to a real-valued prediction for the median.
Results. Our evaluation metric is the mean squared error (MSE) and R2 on a test set of sequences. Results for n = {5, 9, 15} images are shown in Table 2. The Vanilla NN baseline while incurring a large MSE, is competitive on the R2 metric. The other baselines give comparable performance on the MSE metric. The proposed sortnet approaches outperform the competing methods on both the metrics considered. The stochastic sortnet approach is the consistent best performer on MSE, while the deterministic sortnet is slightly better on the R2 metric.

6.3 END-TO-END, DIFFERENTIABLE k-NEAREST NEIGHBORS

Setup. In this experiment, we design a fully differentiable, end-to-end k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier. Unlike a standard kNN classifier which computes distances between points in a predefined space, we learn a representation of the data points before evaluating the k-nearest neighbors.
Every sequence of items here consists of a query point and a randomly sampled subset of n candidate nearest neighbors from the training set. In principle, we could use the entire training set (excluding the query point) as candidate points, but this can hurt the learning both computationally and statistically. The query points are randomly sampled from the train/validation/test sets as appropriate but the nearest neighbors are always sampled from the training set. The loss function optimizes for a representation spaces such that the top-k candidate points (with the minimum Euclidean distance to the query point) have the same label as the query point. Figure 4 illustrates the proposed algorithm.
Datasets. We consider the benchmark MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and the CIFAR-10 dataset of natural images (no data augmentation) with the canonical splits for training and testing.
Baselines. We consider kNN baselines that operate in three standard representation spaces: the canonical pixel basis, the basis specified by the top 50 principal components (PCA), a convolutional autonencoder (CAE). Additionally, we experimented with k = 1, 3, 5, 9 nearest neighbors and across two distance metrics: uniform weighting of all k-nearest neighbors and weighting nearest neighbors by the inverse of their distance. For completeness, we trained a CNN using the crossentropy loss with the same architecture as the one used for sortnet (except the final layer).
Results. We report the classification accuracies on the standard test sets in Table 3. On both datasets, the differentiable kNN classifier outperforms all the baseline kNN variants including the convolutional autoencoder approach. The performance is much closer to the accuracy of a standard CNN.

7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a continuous relaxation of the sorting operator to the set of unimodal row stochastic matrices. Our relaxation facilitates gradient estimation on stochastic computation graphs and can be extended to include stochastic nodes corresponding to distributions over permutations. Further, we derived a reparameterized gradient estimator for the Plackett-Luce distribution for efficient stochastic optimization. On three illustrative tasks, our proposed relaxations outperform prior work in end-to-end learning of semantic orderings of high-dimensional objects.
In the future, we would like to explore alternate relaxations to sorting as well as applications that extend widely-used algorithms such as beam search (Goyal et al., 2018). Both our relaxed sort operator and the reparameterizable sampler are easy to implement. We provide reference implementations in Tensorflow (Abadi et al., 2016) and PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) in Appendix A.

B PROOFS OF THEORETICAL RESULTS
B.1 LEMMA 2 Proof. For any value of , the following inequalities hold:

kk
s[i] = k + (s[i] - )
i=1 i=1 k
 k + max(s[i] - , 0)
i=1 n
 k + max(si - , 0).
i=1
Furthermore, for  = s[k]:
nn
k + max(si - , 0) = s[k]k + max(si - s[k], 0)
i=1 i=1 k
= s[k]k + (s[i] - s[k])
i=1 k
= s[i].
i=1
This finishes the proof.

B.2 COROLLARY 3

Proof. We first consider at exactly what values of  the sum in Lemma 2 is minimized. For simplicity we will only prove the case where all values of s are distinct.

The equality

k i=1

s[i]

=

k +

n i=1

max(si

-

,

0)

holds

only

when

s[k]







s[k+1].

By

Lemma 2, these values of  also minimize the RHS of the equality.

Symmetrically, if one considers the score vector t = -s, then (n - k + 1) +

n i=1

max(ti

-

,

0)

is minimized at t[n-k+1]    t[n-k+2].

Replacing  by - and using the definition of t implies that (k - 1 - n) +

n i=1

max(

-

si

,

0)

is minimized at s[k-1]    s[k].

It follows that:

n

s[k]

=

arg min
s

k +

max(si - , 0) +

i=1

n

= arg min (2k - 1 - n) + |si - |.
s i=1

n
(k - 1 - n) + max( - si, 0)
i=1

Thus, if si = s[k], then i = arg min(2k - 1 - n)s + As1. This finishes the proof.

B.3 THEOREM 4 We prove the two properties in the statement of the theorem independently:
13

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019

1. Unimodality

Proof. By definition of the softmax function, the entries of P are positive and sum to 1. To
show that P satisfies the argmax permutation property, . Formally, for any given row i, we construct the argmax permutation vector u as:
ui = arg max[soft max((n + 1 - 2i)s - As1)] = arg max[(n + 1 - 2i)s - As1]
= [i]
where the square notation [i] denotes the index of the i-th largest element. The first step follows from the fact that the softmax function is monotonically increasing and hence, it preserves the argmax. The second equality directly follows from Corollary 3. By definition, sort(s) = {[1], [2], . . . , [n]}, finishing the proof.

2. Limiting behavior

Proof. As shown in Gao & Pavel (2017), the softmax function may be equivalently

defined as soft max(z/ ) = arg maxxn-1 x, z - 

n i=1

xi

log

xi

.

In particular,

lim0 soft max(z/ ) = arg max x. The distributional assumptions ensure that the el-

ements of s are distinct a.s., so plugging in z = (n + 1 - 2k)s - As1 completes the

proof.

B.4 PROPOSITION 5
This result follows from an earlier result by Yellott Jr (1977). We give the proof sketch below and refer the reader to Yellott Jr (1977) for more details.
Sketch. Consider random variables {Xi}in=1 such that Xi  Exp(szi )). We may prove by induction a generalization of the memoryless property:

q(X1  и и и  Xn|x  min Xi)
i



= q(x  X1  x + t|x  min Xi)q(X2  и и и  Xn|x + t  min Xi)dt

0i

i2



= q(0  X1  t)q(X2  и и и  Xn|x + t  min Xi)dt.
0 i2

If we assume as inductive hypothesis that q(X2  и и и  Xn|x + t  mini2 Xi) = q(X2  и и и  Xn|t  mini2 Xi), we complete the induction as:

q(X1  и и и  Xn|x  min Xi)
i 
= q(0  X1  t)q(X2  и и и  Xn|t  min Xi)dt
0 i2
= q(X1  X2  и и и  Xn|0  min Xi).
i

It follows from a familiar property of argmin of exponential distributions that:

q(X1  X2  и и и  Xn) = q(X1  min Xi)q(X2  и и и  Xn|X1  min Xi)

and by another induction, we have q(X1  и и и  Xn) =

Finally, following the argument of Balog et al. (2017), we apply the strictly decreasing function g(x) = - log x to this identity, which from the definition of the Gumbel distribution implies:

C ARG MAX SEMANTICS FOR TIED MAX ELEMENTS
While applying the arg max operator to a vector with duplicate entries attaining the max value, we need to define the operator semantics for arg max to handle ties in the context of the proposed relaxation. Definition 6. For any vector with ties, let arg max set denote the operator that returns the set of all indices containing the max element. We define the arg max of the i-th in a matrix M recursively:
1. If there exists an index j  {1, 2, . . . , n} that is a member of arg max set(M [i, :]) and has not been assigned as an arg max of any row k < i, then the arg max is the smallest such index.
2. Otherwise, the arg max is the smallest index that is a member of the arg max set(M [i, :]).
This function is efficiently computable with additional bookkeeping. Lemma 7. For an input vector s with the sort permutation matrix given as Psort(s), we have sj1 = sj2 if and only if there exists a row i such that P [i, j1] = P [i, j2] for all j1, j2  {1, 2, . . . , n}.

Proof. From Eq. 4, we have the i-th row of P [i, :] given as:

P [i, :] = soft max [((n + 1 - 2i)s - As1)/ ]

. Therefore, we have the equations:

P [i, j1]

=

exp(((n

+

1

-

2i)sj1 Z

-

(As1)i)/ )

=

P [i, j2]

=

exp(((n + 1

-

2i)sj2 Z

-

(As1)i)/ )

for some fixed normalization constant Z.

As the function f (x)

=

exp(((n+1-2i)x-(As1)i)/ ) Z

is

invertible, both directions of the lemma follow immediately.

Lemma 8. If arg max set(P [i1, :]) and arg max set(P [i2, :]) have a non-zero intersection, then arg max set(P [i1, :]) = arg max set(P [i2, :]).

Proof. Assume without loss of generality that | arg max set(P [i1, :])| > 1 for some i. Let j1, j2 be two members of | arg max set(P [i1, :])|. By Lemma 7, sj1 = sj2 , and therefore P [i2, j1] = P [i2, j2]. Hence if j1  arg max set(P [i2, :]), then j2 is also an element. A symmetric argument implies that if j2  arg max set(P [i2, :]), then j1 is also an element for arbitrary j1, j2  | arg max set(P [i1, :])|. This completes the proof.
Proposition 9. (Argmax Permutation with Ties) For s = [s1, s2, . . . , sn]T  Rn, the vector z defined by zi = arg maxj Psort(s)[i, j] is such that z  Zn.

15

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019
Proof. From Corollary 3, we know that the row Psort(s)[i, :] attains its maximum (perhaps nonuniquely) at some Psort(s)[i, j] where sj = s[i]. Note that s[i] is well-defined even in the case of ties. Consider an arbitrary row Psort(s)[i, :] and let arg max set(Psort(s)[i, :]) = {j1, . . . , jm}. It follows from Lemma 7 that there are exactly m scores in s that are equal to s[i]: sj1 , . . . , sjm . These scores corresponds to m values of s[i ] such that s[i ] = s[i], and consequently to m rows P [i , :] that are maximized with values s[i ] = s[i] and consequently (by Lemma 8) at indices j1, . . . , jm.
Suppose we now chose an i such that s[i ] = s[i]. Then P [i , :] attains its maximum at some P sort(s)[i , j ] where sj = s[i ]. Because sj = s[i ] = s[i] = sj, Lemma 7 tells us that P [i , :] does not attain its maximum at any of j1, . . . , jm. Therefore, only m rows have a non-zero arg max set intersection with arg max set(P [i, :]). Because P [i, :] is one of these rows, there can be up to m - 1 such rows above it. Because each row above only has one arg max assigned via the tie-breaking protocol, it is only possible for up to m - 1 elements of arg max set(P [i, :]) to have been an arg max of a previous row k < i. As | arg max set(P [i, :])| = m, there exists at least one element that has not been specified as the arg max of a previous row (pigeon-hole principle). Thus, the arg max of each row are distinct. Because each argmax is also an element of {1, . . . , n}, it follows that z  Zn.
D EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND ANALYSIS
We used Tensorflow (Abadi et al., 2016) for our experiments. In Appendix A, we provide "plugin" snippets for implementing our proposed relaxations in both Tensorflow (Abadi et al., 2016) and PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017). We will make the full codebase used for reproducing the experiments open source upon the completion of the review process.
For the sorting and quantile regression experiments, we used standard training/validation/test splits of 50, 000/10, 000/10, 000 images of MNIST for constructing the large-MNIST dataset. We ensure that only digits in the standard training/validation/test sets of the MNIST dataset are composed together to generate the corresponding sets of the large-MNIST dataset. For CIFAR-10, we used a split of 45, 000/5000/10, 000 examples for training/validation/test. With regards to the baselines considered, we note that the REINFORCE based estimators were empirically observed to be worse than almost all baselines for all our experiments. We now report experimental details with regards to the individual experiments.
D.1 SORTING HANDWRITTEN NUMBERS
Architectures. We control for the choice of computer vision models by using the same convolutional network architecture for each sorting method. This architecture is as follows:
Conv[Kernel: 5x5, Stride: 1, Output: 140x28x32, Activation: Relu]  Pool[Stride: 2, Output: 70x14x32]  Conv[Kernel: 5x5, Stride: 1, Output: 70x14x64, Activation: Relu]  Pool[Stride: 2, Output: 35x7x64]  FC[Units: 64, Activation: Relu]
Note that the dimension of a 5-digit large-MNIST image is 140О28. The primary difference between our methods is how we combine the scores to output a row stochastic prediction matrix.
For Sortnet-based methods, we use another fully-connected layer of dimension 1 to map the image representations to n scalar scores. In the case of Stochastic Sortnet, we then sample from the PL distribution by perturbing the scores multiple times with Gumbel noise. Finally, we use the Sortnet operator to map the set of n scores (or each set of n perturbed scores) to its corresponding unimodal row stochastic matrix.

For Sinkhorn-based methods, we use a fully-connected layer of dimension n to map each image to an n-dimensional vector. These vectors are then stacked into an n О n matrix. We then either map this matrix to a corresponding doubly-stochastic matrix (Sinkhorn) or sample directly from a distribution over permutation matrices via Gumbel perturbations (Gumbel-Sinkhorn). We implemented the Sinkhorn operator based on code snippets obtained from the open source implementation of Mena et al. (2018) available at https://github.com/google/gumbel sinkhorn. For the Vanilla RS baseline, we ran each element through a fully-connected n dimensional layer, concatenated the representations of each element and then fed the results through three fullyconnected n2-unit layers to output multiclass predictions for each rank. All our methods yield row stochastic n О n matrices as their final output. Our loss is the row-wise cross-entropy loss between the true permutation matrix and the row stochastic output.
Hyperparameters. For this experiment, we used an Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10-4 and a batch size of 20. Continuous relaxation to sorting also introduce another hyperparameter: the temperature  for the Sinkhorn-based and sortnet-based approaches. We tuned this hyperparameter on the set {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} by picking the model with the best validation accuracy on predicting entire permutations (as opposed to predicting individual maps between elements and ranks).
Effect of temperature. In Figure 5, we report the log-variance in gradient estimates as a function of the temperature  . Similar to the effect of temperature observed for other continuous relaxations to discrete objects such as Gumbel-softmax (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2017), we note that higher temperatures lead to lower variance in gradient estimates.
D.2 QUANTILE REGRESSION Architectures. Due to resource constraints, we ran the quantile regression experiment on 4-digit numbers instead of 5-digit numbers. We use the same neural network architecture as previously used in the sorting experiment.

The vanilla NN baseline for quantile regression was generated by feeding the CNN representations into a series of three fully-connected layers of ten units each, the last of which mapped to a singleunit estimate of the median. In the other experiments, one copy of this network was used to estimate each element's rank through a method like Gumbel-Sinkhorn or Sortnet that produces a row stochastic matrix, while another copy was used to estimate each element's value directly. Point predictions are obtained by multiplying the center row of the matrix with the column vector of estimated values, and we minimize the 2 loss between these point predictions and the true median, learning information about ordering and value simultaneously. Hyperparameters. For this experiment, we used an Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10-4 and a batch size of 5. The temperature  was tuned on the set {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} based on the validation loss. Further Analysis. In Figure 6, we show the scatter plots for the true vs. predicted medians on 2000 test points from the large-MNIST dataset as we vary n. For stochastic sortnet, we average the predictions across 5 samples. As we increase n, the distribution of true medians concentrates, leading to an easier prediction problem (at an absolute scale) and hence, we observe lower MSE for larger n in Table 2. However, the relatively difficulty of the problem increases with increasing n, as the model is trying to learn a semantic sorting across a larger set of elements. This is reflected in the R2 values in Table 2 which show a slight dip as n increases. D.3 END-TO-END, DIFFERENTIABLE k-NEAREST NEIGHBORS Architectures. The baseline kNN implementation for the pixel basis, PCA basis and the convolutional autoencoder was done using sklearn.

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019
For the MNIST experiments with Sortnet, we used a network similar to the large-MNIST network used in the previous experiments:
Conv[Kernel: 5x5, Stride: 1, Output: 28x28x32, Activation: Relu]  Pool[Stride: 2, Output: 14x14x32]  Conv[Kernel: 5x5, Stride: 1, Output: 14x14x64, Activation: Relu]  Pool[Stride: 2, Output: 7x7x64]  FC[Units: 64, Activation: Relu] For the CIFAR experiments with Sortnet, we also make use of local response normalization (LRN) layers and a second fully-connected layer: Conv[Kernel: 5x5, Stride: 2, Output: 28x28x64, Activation: Relu]  Pool[Stride: 2, Output:14x14x64]  LRN  Conv[Kernel: 5x5, Stride: 2, Output: 14x14x64, Activation: Relu]  LRN  Pool[Stride: 2, Output: 7x7x64, Activation: Relu]  FC[Units: 384]  FC[Units: 192] Hyperparameters. For this experiment, we used an Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10-5 and a batch size of 10 queries and 100 neighbor candidates. We tuned the temperature parameter on the set {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}. The number of nearest neighbors k was selected from the set {1, 3, 5, 9}. The model with the best evaluation loss was evaluated on the test set.
